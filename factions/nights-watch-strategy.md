# Night's Watch - Strategy Sheet

At the end of Month 6, the Night's Watch gain the following Might based on how well the Seven Kingdoms were protected:

## BANISHED TO THE WALL

If all Abandoned Castles around Eastwatch-by-the-Sea are restored, gain +1 Coin equal to the combined range of every Dock controlled by the Night's Watch at the start of every Month

Once per Campaign you may deploy an army with all unlocked list bonuses from the Wall in a Region outside the Wall Realm. This army must include two Commander Characters in their Attachment version (not counting the army's normal Commander). Declare this when your army list is revealed.

Enemy Characters who are taken under Night's Watch control using the Take the Black Tactics card and are still on the board at the conclusion of a battle must make a Capture Save with -4 to their roll even if the Night's Watch was defeated.

If all Abandoned Castles around Castle Black are restored, each time you defeat an enemy in battle gain an amount of Might equal to their Might Rank bonus (or their team Might Rank bonus) from that battle. If their Might Rank bonus was reduced by a special effect, disregard that reduction.

If all Abandoned Castles around The Shadow Tower are restored, each time a Night's Watch unit gains Veterancy it may roll twice on the Veterancy table and take both results, rerolling if a repeat number is rolled.

The Night's Watch are sworn to the protection of the Seven Kingdoms and serve at the Wall until death. Of the original nineteen castles that once fortified the Wall, only three remain garrisoned: Castle Black, Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower. The Night's Watch must seek to restore the Abandoned Castles along the wall which function as special Developments purchased for -1 Might rather than -1 Coin. Each faction (including the Night's Watch) may contribute -1 Might from its own respective total Might during Council Phase for the restoration of one Abandoned Castle per Month. Abandoned Castles may be restored in any Region which the Night's Watch still holds. The Night's Watch must seek to convince the other Factions of their need for contributions through Coin, promsises of aid in battle, or any other diplomatic means. When a Wall Region is Sacked, the Attacker chooses one Abandoned Castle in that Region, it is no longer restored. If the Night's Watch loses control of any of the three Regional Castles, they temporarily lose all bonuses from any restored Abandoned Castles in that Region until they regain control of the Region. While held, all list size bonsues from Abandoned Castles are useable in every Region of the Wall Realm simultaneously (including The Gift).
