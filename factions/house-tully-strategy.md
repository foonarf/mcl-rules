House Tully of the Riverlands occupies a crucial territory for both the military and economic aspirations of the other Great Houses of Westeros. As rivals make their moves, the Riverlords will have to fight for every inch of their homeland or wither in the shadow of others' ambition.

When House Tully becomes a Vassal, transfer half (round down) of your current Might and Coin to your Overlord immediately when the Overlord is declared during Council Phase each Month. If House Tully becomes a Vassal to a second Overlord Faction or declares independence during a later Month, transfer up to three Regions (with any unlocked Developments) in the Riverlands held by your previous Overlord to the new Overlord or House Tully (if turning Independent). This effect may only occur once during the Campaign. If House Tully changes to another Overlord or abandons the fealty of their Overlord a second time, only one Region may be transfered in this manner. At the end of Month 6, transfer all remaning Might and Coin to your Overlord.
