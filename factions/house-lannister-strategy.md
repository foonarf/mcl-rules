## THE POWER OF COIN

As the richest house in Westeros, the Lannisters use wealth to dominate their rivals. To represent the gold mines beneath Casterly Rock, during Council Phase privately roll a d6 and gain that amount of Coin. On a 6, add +6 Coin but then discontinue this effect for the rest of the Campaign, allowing opponents of the Lannisters to believe that the mines beneath Casterly Rock have not run dry. Unlike other factions, the Lannisters do not reveal their total Coin unless requested to do so by a Referee.

During Council Phase the Lannisters may voluntarily declare their current total Coin. If no other faction has a greater amount of Coin than the Lannisters at that time, immediately gain Might equal to the difference between the Lannisters' Coin and the next richest faction up to +10 Might.

Dismiss Barristan Selmy from the Kingsguard, causing him to join the Targaryens. Gain +5 Might. Send Arys Oakheart on a royal escort to Dorne, causing him to join the Martells. Gain +5 Might. Cause Sandor Clegane to desert his post, making him a Neutral character and hireable during Council Phase. Gain +5 Might If you hold King's Landing, blow up the Great Sept of Baelor using wildfire, Killing the High Sparrow and removing your access to Warrior's Sons, Poor Fellows and Champions of the Faith. Gain +10 Might. If you hold King's Landing, levy an inordinate tax on the populace of the city. Gain +10 Coin. Bask in the supremacy of the Lannister Dynasty. Count every faction that has fewer Total Coin than you at the end of Month 6. Gain +2 Might to House Lannister for each of those factions.

The Lannisters must conduct an auction of all available Neutral Characters during Council Phase each month. This auction may be performed in any manner as long as all other factions have an oppotunity to bid their maximum desired Coin on any available Neutral character using Might Rank to break ties. The Lannisters may choose to outbid their opponents for any character using their own Coin before moving on to the next character for auction. The Lannisters gain +2 to their army list size for each level of Coin Bonus they purchase (+2, +4, +6 instead of +1, +2, +3).
