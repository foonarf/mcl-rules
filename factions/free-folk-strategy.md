# Free Folk - Strategy Sheet

## The Horde United

### Motivations Rule
The various clans of Free Folk rarely unite because of their diverse Motivations. Each Month during Council Phase, assign Commanders who are not Injured or Captured to one of the Motivation tracks listed here. Each Commander occupies one position on the track beginning on the left. The first two positions on each track are faction-wide harmful effects that are disabled when a Commander occupies them. The remaining positions provide bonuses to each Commander sharing their respective Motivation track for the duration of the Month.

## The Final March
At the end of Month 6, Free Folk gain the following Might based on how many positions were occupied in each Motivation track at the start of Month 6.

- Multiply the number of occupied positions in **The Old Ways** track **x5** and gain that amount of Might.
- Multiply the number of occupied positions in **Death to Kneelers** track **x2** and gain that amount of Might for each enemy Character who was Killed as a result of battle against the Free Folk or another special effect triggered by the Free Folk.
- Multiply the number of occupied positions in **Desperate Migration** track **x3** and gain that amount of Might for each Region held that is not Beyond the Wall. (Include the Wall Realm and all other Realms in this count.)

## Special Abilities

### Kneel to No Man
Free Folk must re-roll for an Event if (4), (12), or (20) are rolled. If all other Events have already been rolled then Free Folk may reuse the next Event that is rolled.

### Tide of the Free
Free Folk may only Conquer Regions adjacent to currently controlled Free Folk Regions by land or by a Free Folk controlled Dock. Free Folk are immune to the effects of Depleted Reserves. Conquering costs 1 fewer Might (-1 Might rather than -2 Might.)
