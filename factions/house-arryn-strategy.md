# House Arryn - Strategy Sheet

## SOLITUDE OF THE VALE

Each time an Arryn Commander marches to battle outisde the Vale Realm, he fights with increased strength when Commanding as long as his home Region or Development remains safely in the hands of House Arryn or their Overlord.

While independent, House Arryn must pay -3 Coin to unlock any Developments in the Vale (rather than the usual -1 Coin) and an additional -2 Coin for restoring Sacked Developments (-5 Coin total). If Petyr Baelish is in the service of House Arryn, ignore this effect. Instead, suffer -2 Might each time House Arryn or their Overlord unlocks or restores a Sacked Development in the Vale.

When House Arryn becomes a Vassal, transfer half (round up) of your current Coin to your Overlord immediately when the Overlord is declared during Council Phase each Month. House Arryn may not transfer any Might to their Overlord until the end of Month 6. If House Arryn declares independence from an Overlord from the previous Month or changes its Overlord, select up to three Regions and their unlocked Developments in the Vale. Paying -5 Might per Region, you immediately take control of them as House Arryn (if independent) or your new Overlord. At the end of Month 6, if the Arryn's Overlord controls every Region in the Vale, transfer all of your current Might to your Overlord. Otherwise, transfer half (round up) of your current Might to your Overlord.

- Month 1 - Independent
- Month 2 - Must be any faction holding 2 or more Regions in the Vale / Otherwise may be independent
- Month 3 - Must be any faction holding 3 or more Regions in the Vale / Otherwise may be independent
- Month 4 - Must be the faction holding the Eyrie / Otherwise may be independent
- Month 5 - Any faction / Otherwise may be independent

House Arryn benefits from the legendary mountainous protection of the Vale and knightly bannermen to match any Great House of Westeros. Their secure isolation and strength of arms makes them an enticing ally in war. However, they are also capable of building up and withhholding their elite forces, waiting to emerge until all their rivals have been exhausted.
