# Brotherhood - Strategy Sheet

Once per Month during Council Phase the Brotherhood may declare a Trial by Combat for any Captured character held by any faction. Involved factions may not negotiate release of the character until the Trial is resolved. The Captive's faction and the faction holding the Captive each choose one Champion character who is available to be present in a Region chosen by the faction holding the captive. Champions may not be intercepted on their way to the Trial. The Captive may serve as their own Champion and either Champion may be a character from allied factions. The Brotherhood must declare one of the Champions to be Favored. Champion factions each roll a d6 and add the modifiers below. If the Captive's Champion wins, the Captive is released. and the opposing Champion makes a Death Save -2. If the Champion of the faction holding the Captive wins or ties, the Captive is executed and their Champion (if different) makes a Death Save -2.

## JUSTICE

## CURRENT

Opposing factions do not gain Might Rank bonuses in 1v1 battles against the Brotherhood. In Team Battles, the highest Might Rank opponent counts as having the same Might Rank as the Brotherhood. If the Brotherhood has not yet acquired Catelyn Stark, they may bid on one Neutral Commander with a +3 Coin equivalent credit. (The credit remains available if you are outbid.)

At the end of Month 6, gain an amount of Might equal to your total current Justice.

The Brotherhood may never take control of any Region and instead takes control of Developments by Conquering or Routing. There is no Might or Coin cost when the Brotherhood takes control of a Development. Brotherhood control of Developments persists even if the attached Region is controlled by another faction and may only be removed if that faction Challenging the Region specifically declares that they are targeting the Brotherhood Development. In such cases the Brotherhood may use any Castles tied to that Development.
