# House Bolton - Strategy Sheet

## LONG-TERM PLANNING

House Bolton is feared as an especially cunning and fearsome force throughout Westeros. Each Bolton Commander generates Schemes at the end of every Month. At the start of every Month, gain the amount of Might equal to the current total number of Schemes across all Commanders. Dead Commanders and Neutral Commanders do not generate Schemes. Injured and Captured Bolton Commanders continue to generate Schemes. When a Bolton Commander Dies, his remaining Schemes may be distributed to the other Bolton Commanders. Schemes may be expended for the immediate effects listed below but only when the character is acting as a Commander. Boltons may include any Neutral Combat unit for no cost and may play their Commanders as Neutral. Other factions wishing to include Neutral Bolton units in their army must do so with the consent of the Boltons and must pay the Coin cost for those Mercenaries directly to the Boltons.
