The faction controlling the Red Keep Development gains access to the Iron Throne Strategy. During Council Phase, when Neutral Characters are being auctioned, this faction may enhance their bid with the equivalent value of +2 Coin by promising that Neutral Character a council seat on the Small Council (plus any additional Coin needed to win the bid and complete the appointment). Characters who die while on the Small Council may have their seat immediately reappointed by the Iron Throne faction for no cost. Characters who are Captured while holding a Small Council seat retain their seat but lose the associated bonus until the following Council Phase, at which time the seat may be reappointed for the normal cost. Each seat begins the Campaign with a default character. These characters may be replaced by the Iron Throne faction during Council Phase. If Petyr Baelish and Varys are not bid on by other factions, they may retain their seats and are automatically controlled by the Iron Throne faction. If Kings Landing is Conquered or Sacked, the Iron Throne Strategy is nullified until the next Council Phase.

Master of Ships

Master of Coin

Appointments cost -1 Coin unless they are made as a result of betrayal or Character Death.

Varys

- Must be a Commander.
- During Challenge Phase this Character may Challenge a Sea Region to set up a Blockade of an adjacent land Region. Blockades remove all Might and Coin income from a Region and Development Perks and divert those bonuses to the character's faction. Blockades may be countered, resulting in a Sea Battle. The Blockade's effect is removed if the Master of Ships is defeated in battle or if they are stripped of the title.
- When starting a Challenge Phase at sea, this Commander may move up to two Sea Regions away when performing a Challenge.

## THE SMALL COUNCIL

- Must be an NCU.
- King's Landing gains +3 Coin (Iron Throne faction)
- All other Capitals gain +2 Coin (character's faction)

If any Character's faction participates in a betrayal of the Iron Throne Faction, opposing them in battle during Challenge Phase, their council seat may be immediately reappointed by the Iron Throne as soon as that Challenge or Skirmish is logged on the Challenge Log. This effect is not triggered if the Iron Throne faction chooses to initiate a battle against the Character's faction.

Lord Commander of the Kingsguard

- Must be an Attachment or Commander.
- When this Character is attached to a unit in a Challenge battle for their faction, that unit gains Veterancy before deployment, rather than at the end of the battle.
- When this Character's unit gains Veterancy, that unit my roll twice on the Veterancy table (re-rolling if the same number is rolled) and choose the preferred result.

Master of Whisperers

- This character's faction rolls twice for Events (re-rolling if the same number is rolled) and choose the preferred result.
