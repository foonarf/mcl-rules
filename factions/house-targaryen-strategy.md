# House Targaryen - Strategy Sheet

During Challenge Phase, Targaryen Commanders may be put forth in Challenges (but not Skirmishes) starting in any eastern Sea Region and then moving onto an adjacent land Region. If there is a hostile Commander in the Sea Region who does not consent to that movement, the Targaryens may Challenge in that Sea Region instead. The eastern Sea Regions are the Shivering Sea, the Narrow Sea, Stepstones, and the Summer Sea.

- Daario Naharis may be bid on conventionally during the Neutral auction or may be permanently acquired.

- Barristan Selmy may be acquired upon becoming Injured or upon being released by the Lannisters at the end of Month 1.

- Months 1 and 2: +3 Might
- Months 3 and 4: +2 Might
- Months 5 and 6: +1 Might

During Challenge Phase gain +3 Might each time the Targaryens Challenge an opposing faction they have not yet Challenged. Gain +4 Might each time the Targaryens Challenge in a new Realm.

For each Capital controlled by House Targaryen, gain control of one Neutral Region in the same Realm at the end of each Month. If there are no Neutral Regions in that Realm, choose one Region in that Realm controlled by the lowest possible Might Rank faction and take control of it, including any unlocked Developments if they are held by the same faction. At the end of Month 6, gain +7 Might for each Capital controlled.

Each Targaryen Commander who is on the map or in Reserve contributes bonus Might at the start of each Month. Daenerys Targaryen earns double Might from this effect.

The invasion by House Targaryen is powerful and well-funded but risks exhausting itself if aggressive momentum is not maintained. The Targaryens begin the Campaign with no controlled Regions and must use their Commanders in Challenges or Skirmishes from adjacent Sea Regions during Month 1. At the start of each Month the Targaryens must select and declare one War Focus which provides faction-wide bonuses for the duration of the Month. Each War Focus includes several optional list bonuses. Each Targaryen army deployed may utilize up to three from the Current War Focus. Up to two additional may be acquired at a cost of -1 Might each per battle.
