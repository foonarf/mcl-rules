House Stark of the North may draw strength from a sequence of Sacrifices and Retributions over the course of the Campaign. The Starks may choose to trigger the Sacrifices listed here at the end of Months 1, 2, and 3. Each Sacrifice includes a one-time Might bonus as well as a number of list size bonuses which are accessible throughout the rest of the Campaign. Each Sacrifice unlocked ensures that a corresponding Retribution will be unlocked at the start of a later Month with greater bonuses.
