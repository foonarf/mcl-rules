House Greyjoy Commanders who are placed on Sea Regions are considered Iron Fleets, rather than typical fleets used by the other factions. Iron Fleets are comprised of a Fleet Captain, Flagship, Support ships, and potentially a Vendetta. Fleet Captains may perform Challenges or Skirmishes on land Regions adjacent to their Sea Region. Leave the Commander placed on the Sea Region when moving on the map and declare the adjacent land Region as the battle location. When Iron Fleets participate in Sea Battles, opponents do not gain Commander or Might Rank list bonuses unless one of their opponents' Commanders is the Master of Ships. House Greyjoy Combat Units take -2 Wounds from the Torrent keyword (D6-1 instead of D6+1). A Flagship is destroyed if its Fleet Captain is Killed as a result of a Sea Battle and may only be transferred to another Fleet (costing -2 Might) if its Captain is Killed during a land battle. Commanders acting as Fleet Captains may only occupy Sea Regions on the map unless they give control of their Iron Fleet to another available Commander from Reserve. Place that Commander on the map in the Sea Region and label them as the new Fleet Captain. That replacement may not Challenge or Skirmish this Month. When Fleet Captains are Injured they stay on the map in their Iron Fleet. If their Sea Region is Challenged while they are Injured, or if the Fleet Captain is a fresh replacement, they must Withdraw to one adjacent Sea Region or be Vanquished. Gain +2 Might each Month for each Iron Fleet in play, including any that were unlocked at the start of the Month.
