May only use Loyalty units and Attachments

Announce Declared Realms for either brother (x10 Legitimacy each) during Council Phase as long as they contain at least one Baratheon controlled Region. Realms may change Loyalty between brothers during Council Phase. If any Baratheon Commander moves into or through a Declared Realm which does not match his Loyalty, he is automatically Injured at the start of the next Council Phase.

House Baratheon forces are divided in their Loyalty between Stannis and Renly. Keep a current tally of the Legitimacy score of each brother and reward them with the bonuses from the side columns when they meet the requirements. Only reward the leading brother with the rewards from the center column. If the scores are equal, both brothers gain the bonuses of the center column. Reset the tally at the end of the Month and only carry over the cumulative Legitimacy from the Victories columns into the next Month.

If no Stannis Commanders participate in a Challenge battle this Month, lose -8 Might.

If no Renly Commanders participate in a Challenge battle this Month, lose -8 Might.

When Renly Loyalty units gain Veterancy, roll twice on the Veterancy table and choose the result. If Renly has the Greater Claim at the end of Month 6, gain +1 Might for each Veterancy bonus applied to surviving Renly Loyalty Units.

If two Stannis Loyalty units (including NCUs) were destroyed during a battle, when you award Veterancy, award two effects to that Veteran unit. If Stannis has the Greater Claim at the end of Month 6, gain +3 Might for every Dead Stannis Loyalty Character.

Either brother may be Killed by the other during Council Phase after Month 1. If one brother is Killed the other gains a permanent bonus of +20 Legitimacy (log under Victories). Commander Loyalty restrictions remain in effect for army lists but Commanders are no longer Injured for violations of Declared Realms. All Baratheon units who gain Veterancy must keep assigned the Loyalty of the Commander which they originally fought under.

## LOYALTY & LEGITIMACY

Baratheon Commanders contribute to Legitimacy (x2 each) as long as they are not Captured or Killed.

Baratheon controlled Regions with purchased Developments within a Declared Realm count as Sworn Houses (x3 each) and must count for the same brother as the Declared Realm they are in.
