# House Tyrell - Strategy Sheet

If more friendly Combat Units were destroyed than enemy Combat Units, your opponents gain +1 Might for each additional Combat Unit they destroyed.

If more friendly Combat Units survived than enemy Combat Units, gain +1 Coin for each additional Combat Unit survived.

House Tyrell is as renowned for its wealth and prosperity as it is for the size of its vast army. Always the political climbers, the lords and ladies of Highgarden deftly maneuver into positions of power as allies of the strongest forces in Westeros. Their friends reap the benefits of money and manpower -- their enemies are just another rung on the ladder to domination.

When House Tyrell becomes a Vassal, transfer all current Might to your Overlord immediately when the Overlord is declared during Council Phase each Month. House Tyrell is not required to transfer any Coin to their Overlord until the end of Month 6. Highgarden (and Horn Hill if unlocked) remains under the control of House Tyrell unless it is Conquered by a Faction other than its Overlord. It is never transferred to the Overlord of House Tyrell until the end of Month 6. If House Tyrell declares independence or changes its Overlord, select up to three Regions in the Reach and their unlocked Developments. Paying -5 Coin per Region, you immediately take control of the them as House Tyrell (if independent) or your new Overlord.
