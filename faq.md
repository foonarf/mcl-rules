# Season 1 FAQ

Milestone Campaign League Season One FAQ

## General

- Independent Vassal Factions can be bumped from battles during Challenge Phase by Factions who have the same Might Rank as the Vassal's Independent Might Rank.
- Withdraw rules correction: Core Rules p7 mistakenly states that "Commanders may Withdraw from a land Region to a Sea Region only if the battle Region's Dock was controlled by the Withdrawing Commander's Faction prior to the battle." This should instead read: "Commanders may Withdraw from a land Region to a another land Region connected by a Dock only if there are no hostile Commanders in the intervening Sea Region(s) and if the battle Region's Dock was controlled by the Withdrawing Commander's Faction prior to the battle."  There is no default restriction for Withdrawing from a land to Sea Region (except for Skagos Development Perk.)
- Protected Withdraw typo: Core Rules p7 final phrase "At the Start of the following Month, this Withdrawing." is nonsense from a prior edit.
- Following Refunded Challenges, the Commander versions that were put forth in the Challenge count as being used for that Month (ineligible to move again by default.)
- Violation Consequences, although unavoidable when impacting their target Faction, may be declined by the Faction whose card was violated.
- Team Battle resignation after a battle has begun must be agreed upon by both team mates.  A single team mate in a team battle may not force a battle to conclude by refusing to participate further (even if, for instance, that player fears the imminent Death of their Commander) and battles may only be "paused" for an extended duration due to legitimate scheduling/real-life issues impacting an involved player when agreed upon by the other involved players.
- "Battle Griefing" is not allowed. Putting forth a Commander in a Challenge or Skirmish when you do not actually intend to play the battle can be allowed in some cases (see Core Rules page 4, "Referee Duty & Documentation"), but taking the field in a battle with the intent to hamstring your allied force rather than try to win the battle is not allowed.
- "Skirmish Griefing" is not allowed. "Skirmish Griefing" occurs when two Factions are conspiring together against one Faction, and are trying to prevent them from being able to fight a battle at all to contest a Region.  One of the ally Factions puts forth a Commander in a Challenge which is opposed by the enemy Faction's Commander in a Skirmish.  The second ally Faction, having a higher Might Rank, puts forth their own Commander on the side of the enemy.  The first ally, receiving no other allied support, declines a Team Battle, causing the enemy to be bumped from the battle for having a lower Might Rank than the second ally.  The first ally gains an automatic victory when the second ally declines to take the field.  This tactic is illegitimate because it has no counter, diminishes the opportunity for legitimately motivated battles to take place, and reflects no plausible scenario that would occur in the setting.
- "Challenge Griefing" is not allowed. "Challenge Sacrificing" occurs when two Factions are conspiring together against one Faction, and are trying to prevent them from being able to Conquer a neutral Region by preventing the opportunity for a battle there through an allied Challenge.  One of the ally Factions puts forth a Commander in a Challenge which is opposed by the enemy Faction's Commander in a Challenge.  The second ally Faction, of higher Might Rank than the enemy, puts forth their own Commander on the side of the enemy.  The first ally declines to take the field in the battle, accepting the Injured Commander penalty.  The second ally chooses to Conquer the neutral Region, overruling the lesser Might Rank enemy who had intended to do so.  This tactic is illegitimate because it has no counter, diminishes the opportunity for legitimately motivated battles to take place, and reflects no plausible scenario that would occur in the setting.  The two allied Factions, rather than colluding to prevent the battle, should simply take the field on the same side in opposition to their enemy.
- "Skirmish Feinting" is allowed. "Skirmish Feinting" occurs when three Factions are conspiring together against one Faction, and are trying to prevent them from declining a Team Battle and instead force a 2v1.  One of the ally Factions places a Commander in opposition to the enemy Faction's Commander.  The second ally Faction joins the side of the first, while the third ally Faction puts forth their Commander on the side of the enemy, fully intending to decline to take the field.  This tactic is legitimate because it is sometimes counterable by the enemy if they have a high enough Might Rank ally to overrule the third Faction and because it costs the use of a Commander to the third Faction without any possibility of victory for them.
- Coordinating a battle should flow in the following sequence:
  1. Agree upon a date, time, and duration with the other involved Players.
  2. Build your army list.
  3. Type in the s1-scribes-and-referees channel "@Referee" to request an available Referee (preferably a non-involved one) to validate your list.
  4. When you receive a response, DM your list to that Referee and receive validation.
  5. Confirm that your opponent(s) have validated their list(s).
  6. Reveal all lists and play the battle.
- Battles of "Predetermined Risk" are allowed but "Predetermined Results" are not allowed. Negotiation between Factions where each side states that they will conclude the battle before a designated level of harm is done is legitimate.  E.g. "If you agree to the same, let us fight this battle but agree to resolving it before either Commander is removed from play." Negotiation between Factions where each side seeks a mutually beneficial result at the expense of earnest competition in the battle is illegitimate.  E.g. "Let us set up a battle where we deploy our armies and set them on points to ensure that we achieve a Close Victory / Close Defeat so that we both get paid Might and are able to trigger beneficial Character Trait effects."
- Trial by Combat locations selected by the "captor" Faction must be a Region or Development controlled by that Faction.
- Captured Characters returning to their Faction as a result of a Trial by Combat do so at the Region which was the site of that Trial.  If they return to their Faction by any other means (not including when an opponent simply declines to take them Captive at the conclusion of a battle) they return to Reserve, regardless of the length of their captivity.
- In situations where mechanics can force a Vassal to swear fealty to a specific Overlord (Tully M2, Tyrell M1/M2) that occurs at Month Start and does not wait for a declaration mid-Council Phase.

## Break the Siege

- "Unexpected Reinforcements", similar to Balon NCU, brings back a destroyed unit with any destroyed Attachments from that unit.

## Brotherhood Without Banners

- "Rungs on the Ladder" effects may be applied to the Brotherhood for Conquering Developments after a battle in the designated Capitals against the designated enemies (rather than Conquering the Region itself).

## House Baratheon

- The Loyalty Challenge penalty is not incurred unless one Loyalty has no Commanders put forth in any Challenge (this does not require that a battle is actually fought.)
- If Highgarden is held by House Tyrell, Horn Hill is held by House Baratheon, and House Tyrell is Vassal to House Baratheon, they may be counted under Sworn Houses for the purposes of Legitimacy.

## House Greyjoy

- "Eyes on the Tides" refers to island Regions.  The island Regions are solely: Bear Island, Pyke, the Arbor, Estermont, Tarth, Dragonstone, and Skagos.
- When Fleet Captains are assigned to newly unlocked Iron Fleets, they may move to the eligible unlock location of that Iron Fleet, ignoring normal location restrictions.

## House Lannister

- When adding Coin from Affluent Commerce counting applicable Regions held at the beginning of the Month, Vassal Factions holding the Lannister Diplomacy card count as "controlling" Regions held by their Overlord.

## House Targaryen

- Dragons Trait Mythic Beasts is meant to include the sentence: "Dragons are immune to location restrictions."
- Mirri Mazduur Trait Life Must Pay for Life should read: "When Mirri participates in a battle and is still in play at the conclusion, before rolling Injury, Death, and Capture saves choose one other friendly Character and one enemy Character who was still in play.  Both Characters must make Death Saves and the enemy Character suffers -1 to their roll."  Characters who were "still in play" at the conclusion of the battle prior to the use of this ability may trigger their own abilities (e.g. Noble or Steward type abilities).
- Missandei Trait Queen's Mouthpiece should not have the text "during Council" as this triggers at the same time as Revealed Loyalists (end of Month).

## House Tyrell

- Baelor Hightower is absent from the Tyrell Character Traits Sheet.  Treat him as having Frontline Warrior and Knight of the Reach Traits.  His location may always be considered the same as Leyton Hightower.

## Neutrals

- When Jaqen H'ghar, Unnamed uses Order: Taking a New Name, that destroyed Infantry Attachment model represents Jaqen H'ghar's Character in MCL for that battle.  If that Attachment is still in play at the conclusion of the battle, Jaqen counts as being still in play at the conclusion of the battle.  Inversely, if the chosen Infantry Attachment was tied to another Character, that Character still counts as being out of play at the conclusion of the battle.

## Night's Watch

- "Speaking the Vow" supersedes some effects that would cause a Character to switch Factions, but not all such effects.  (This will be addressed with clarified language in a later version.)
  - Rising Opportunist (Vargo Hoat, Jokin) supersedes Speaking the Vow.
  - Adventurous Youth (Edric Dayne) does not supersede Speaking the Vow.
  - In general, Neutral Characters who have been purchased through the auction by an ally Faction of the Night's Watch enter the permanent service of the Night's Watch through "Speaking the Vow" are available to the Night's Watch in all their versions permanently (until Death or the triggering of Rising Opportunist)
  - Non-neutral Characters in service of the Night's Watch as a result of Speaking the Vow may not be deployed in their Commander or NCU versions.
  - Exclusive Contracts does not supersede Speaking the Vow.
  - The Tattered Cloak (The Tattered Prince) causes The Tattered Prince to still be hireable by one other Faction during Council Phase Neutral Character auction (not two Factions as is the normal function of this trait.)  The Night's Watch may not bid on The Tattered Prince when he is under the effects of Speaking the Vow.
  - If Empty the Dungeons is triggered on a Faction that had previously given control of a Character through Speaking the Vow, Night's Watch lose the bonus positive effects of Speaking the Vow (Might gain when the Character is played and free inclusion with removal of the Tactics card) instead the Character is now "stuck" in the Night's Watch Faction and only playable by them if it is a Neutral Character.
- For the purposes of The Great Ranging, only bonuses from restored Abandoned Castles apply (effects from "The Wall" on the Strategy Sheet) not Regional or Development bonuses from The Wall Realm.

## S1M2 Adjustments

- Factions holding no Regions or Developments immediately may not hold Captives and immediately release all Captured Characters they are holding upon losing their last Region or Development.
- If one side of a battle resigns a battle prior to the start of Round 4, those Factions may not gain Might or Coin from Character Traits during the resolution of that battle.
- During the resolution of a battle where Factions gain a Total Victory, those Factions' units are immune to negative modifiers on all Saves and, if they were out of play at the conclusion of the battle, are entitled to Injury Saves before Death Saves (avoiding Death and Capture Saves if they pass the Injury Save).
- House Bolton Dreadfort Scheme "Cheating Death" adds the following clause to its effect: "and if he passes that reroll, is no longer Injured."
- In 2v1 Night's Watch battles where they may field two armies, they are still limited to a maximum of two Builder Stone Throwers across both armies.
- The following effect is added to the House Arryn Strategy Sheet: "Tarnished Silver"
  - Lose -5 Might each time House Arryn suffers a Defeat.
  - Lose -10 x [Campaign Month] each time a Faction other than House Arryn or your Overlord takes control of a Region in the Vale.
  - Lose -60 Might each time a Faction other than House Arryn or your Overlord takes control of the Eyrie.
