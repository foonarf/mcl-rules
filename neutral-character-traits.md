# Neutral Character Traits

\* Indicates hirable in Month 1.
\*\* Characters who begin on the Small Council are held by the Lannisters by default unless bid on by other factions.

## Arya Stark
- **Type:** Attachment
- **Affiliation:** Neutral / Stark
- **Trained in Braavos** — When the Starks bid on Arya as a Neutral character they do so with a +2 Coin equivalent credit. If the Starks win the bid, Arya may be played as her Stark or Neutral versions. If Arya's Attachment Ability caused another Attachment to be removed from play during this battle, that Character suffers -1 to Death Save for this battle.
- **Odd Pair** — Arya and Sandor Clegane are bid on as a pair if both are in the Neutral Character pool. If both Arya and Sandor are still in play at the conclusion of the battle, they are immune to negative effects to Death and Capture Saves for that battle.

## Biter *
- **Type:** Attachment
- **Affiliation:** Neutral
- **Mad Dogs** — Rorge and Biter are always bid on as a pair. If both Rorge and Biter are still in play at the conclusion of the battle, choose 1 enemy Character who was off the board at the end of the game, they suffer -1 to their Death Save. (Do not duplicate this effect for both Rorge and Biter.)
- **Feared by Smallfolk** — When participating in a siege battle, gain +1 Might from offensive victories. Gain an additional +1 if Sack is chosen.

## Brienne
- **Type:** Attachment
- **Affiliation:** Neutral / Baratheon
- **Renly's Sworn Sword** — As long as Renly Baratheon is alive Brienne remains a Baratheon character and may be played as Baratheon or Neutral versions in Baratheon armies. House Baratheon may also permit her use as Neutral in any friendly faction requesting her use. If Renly is ever Killed or Captured, Brienne immediately becomes a Neutral character and may only be hired through the Neutral character pool (although she may still be played as her Baratheon versions when in service to the Baratheons).
- **Master of the Duel** — Each time this character participates in (20) Lavish Tourney or a Trial by Combat, they may re-roll one die during that Event or Trial.

## Bronn *
- **Type:** Attachment
- **Affiliation:** Neutral

## Jaqen H'ghar *
- **Type:** Attachment / NCU
- **Affiliation:** Neutral / Stark
- **Three Names** — Jaqen may use the following ability three times in the service of your faction. Each faction who gains his service must keep track of their own uses of this ability when they control him. When Jaqen participates in a battle and is still in play at the end of the battle he may target one enemy Character who is making a Death save. That Character suffers a -2 to their roll.
- **Un-Name Me** — If Arya Stark is in the Stark faction, the Starks may bid on Jaqen with a +2 Coin equivalent credit. The Starks may deploy Jaqen as any version. If Jaqen H'ghar, Mysterious Prisoner is deployed and is out of play at the conclusion of a battle, roll an Injury Save. If he passes he does not have to roll the usual Death and Capture Saves.

## Jokin *
- **Type:** Commander / Attachment
- **Affiliation:** Neutral
- **Mercenary Comrades** — Jokin and the Widower are always bid on as a pair and the Widower joins the same faction as Jokin if Rising Opportunist is triggered. Stormcrow units have no Coin cost in this army. After their faction rolls for an Event, if Jokin is available and the Widower is alive and uninjured, you may immediately replace that Event with (12) Elite Mercenary Contacts; then place Jokin on the board for the Challenge.
- **Rising Opportunist** — During any Council Phase, if any faction has lost enough Commanders due to Death or Capture (not counting Injured Commanders) such that they have fewer than two available Commanders to field at one time, Vargo Hoat and Jokin immediately offer their services to that faction as free, permanent additions to that faction. After one is chosen, the other remains Neutral until these conditions are met again.
