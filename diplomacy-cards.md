# Diplomacy Cards

Diplomacy Cards are cards that each faction can give to one other faction during Council Phase. Once a Diplomatic Card has been given from an originating faction to a target faction in Council Phase, it is not recalled to the originating faction until the next Council Phase. Each faction may be the target of only one Diplomacy Card at any given time and may decline to be the target of a Diplomacy Card at the time it is offered.

The effects of these boons persist on the target faction until the next Council Phase even if the Violation Consequence is triggered before that Council Phase.

Marriage Alliances are declarations that lock in a Diplomacy Card with a target faction, preventing the originating faction from being able to recall the card in a subsequent Council Phase. To declare a Marriage Alliance, both participating factions declare one Character, one male and one female. Note that if either Character ever changes factions, or is not re-obtained by the allied faction in the course of the Neutral character auction, this will immediately terminate the Marriage Alliance. The target faction will then hold the Diplomacy Card of the originating faction perpetually until a Council Phase following the Death of one of those named Characters. Marriage Alliance benefits are shared by both factions but halt immediately at the time of either Character Death. Each faction may only join into one Marriage Alliance per Council Phase.

This is a penalty applied to the target faction if they put forth any Commanders in Challenge Phase for battles in opposition to the originating faction. See The Vassal Lords Rulebook for exceptions. If the Violation Consequence is triggered, the Diplomacy Card will be eligible to be recalled by the originating faction during the subsequent Council Phase.
