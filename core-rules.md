## Design and Intent

The Milestone Campaign League is a narrative game system designed to be played over six months by ten faction leaders (along with any number of extra players supporting them) which utilizes the CMON Ice  and  Fire  Miniatures  Game  to  resolve  battles. This  system  is designed to only marginally alter the fundamental mechanics of the Ice and Fire Miniatures Game battles that occur within it. However, unlike  the  canon  gameplay,  these  battles  will  almost  always  be asymmetrical with odds solidly favoring one side or the other. Players who  prefer  balanced  and  tuned  gameplay  (at  least  to  CMON standards) with well-established "meta" army lists may not enjoy this system. Be warned!

Players  who  are  looking  for  mechanics  that  incentivize  play  well outside the "meta" and who are open to battle goals other than total victory (such as killing an enemy hero to keep them out of the rest of the campaign) are encouraged to try this system. To the real ones out there who have the smarts to be a min-max try-hard but choose to put flavor over function every once in a while, so everyone can have a good time -- this one's for you.

The design priorities of this system are…

- First, fun for the participants
- Second, respect for the lore
- Third, game balance which is subordinate to the others

As I do not own or profit from the commercial source materials, feel free to alter this system to your group's preferences.

## Overview

The  Milestone  Campaign  League  system  is  played  on  a  map  of Westeros  labeling  68  Regions,  with  unique  Developments  and Castles, across 11 Realms.  Ten players are required to participate as Faction  Leaders  who  have  ultimate  control  of  the  ten  in-game Factions.  If approved by the Campaign Organizer, each Faction may also have other players available to fill in for each Faction Leader or make contributions with their consent.  The goal of each Faction is to accumulate more Might than all their rivals in Westeros, proving that they  have  the  strength  to  rule.    At  the  end  of  the  Campaign,  the Factions who have the highest Might Rankings earn the opportunity to take the field in a climactic Final Battle to determine the ultimate winner.

The Campaign is played over six Months with one mandatory play session  for  all  Faction  Leaders,  containing  the  Council  Phase  then Challenge Phase, occurring once per Month. The rest of the Month is an ongoing (approximately 30-days-long) Battle Phase wherein the players resolve their battles at any time on their own accord as they were set during the Challenge Phase.

## Materials

- 1 d20 die (for Events)
- 1 d8 die (for Veterancy)
- 1 copy of Break the Siege and 1 copy of Attack the Vale by Board Man Gaming
- 1 Campaign Map, recommended to be printed at a scale of 2'x4' or larger for Challenge Phase
- 4 Map Details Sheets (North, South, East, and West) / Castle Reference on back
- 11  Strategy  Sheets  (10  Factions,  1  Iron  Throne)  /  Faction Logs, Neutral Character Traits on back
- 10 Faction Character Traits sheets / Veteran Logs on back
- 1 Challenge Log / Events Sheet on back
- 1 Sea Battles Overlay (optional)
- Battle Logs available to all players
- Plastic sheet protectors for 8.5'x11' (optional)
- Fine-point dry erase markers (optional)
- CMON official game materials for ASOIAF TMG

Factions will have two Challenge battles per Month that they 'must play' (or suffer Total Defeats and Injured Commanders) against their foes  for  major  effects  to  the  Campaign. Players  may  choose  to participate in additional Skirmish battles which have lesser effects on the Campaign.

At the next Council Phase, the effects of these battles are manifested on  the  Campaign  map. Players  use  their  Strategy  Sheets  (1-page documents providing special rules for their faction) to compete for dominance  and  attempt  to  finish  the  Campaign  with  the  most Might. Whichever player controls the Red Keep Development has access  to  1  additional  Strategy  (The  Iron  Throne).    At  the  end  of Month  6  two  of  the  highest  opposing  Might  Rank  players  may compete in a climactic Final Battle.

When  organizing  your  own  chapter  of  the  Milestone  Campaign League, after you have gathered a roster of Faction Leaders and other players it is critical that you begin to schedule the Council/Challenge Phase sessions far in advance  and  that your Faction Leaders understand that their presence is required at those events (or that it is their responsibility to send a proxy).

## Council/Challenge Phase Setup

- Place  sheet  protectors  on  Map  Details  Sheets  (Castle Reference slid into the back of the sheet) and place them on the appropriate sides of your map for your players to view.
- Place the following sheets back-to-back inside sheet protectors  and  distribute  them  to  your  players  with  finepoint dry erase markers:
- Strategy Sheets / Faction Logs
- Character Traits / Veteran Log
- Place the Iron Throne Strategy Sheet back-to-back with the Neutral Character Traits sheet and provide it to the player controlling the Red  Keep  Development  (Lannisters  in Month 1).
- Place the Challenge Log back-to-back with the Events Sheet and provide it with the d20 to a Referee designated to read Events and log Challenges during Challenge Phase.
- Make Battle Logs available to players during Battle Phase and ensure  that  they  know  how  to  complete  them  with  the assistance of a Referee.
- Remind  Faction  Leaders  (or  their  proxies)  to  bring  the  all Commander miniatures for their Factions to place on the Campaign Map during Challenge Phase.
- Remind Faction Leaders to bring d6s of their faction if they wish to use them to mark owned Regions on the Campaign Map (optional).

## Settling Disputes

Referees should be selected by your group from among participants who have read the Core Rules and all associated materials. Disputes are settled by the Primary Referee (typically the Campaign Organizer) or, when involving their Faction, by one or a consensus of Secondary Referees. Referees  should  consider  transfers  of  Might  or  Coin  for restitution  penalties  if  players  are  found  to  have  been  exploiting mechanics  unreasonably  against  their  opponents  or  if  egregious mistakes  cause  conditions  deleterious  to  the  fun  of  the  group. Resolutions made during the testing process of the development of this system are logged in the FAQ.

## Primary Referee

## Secondary Referees

Players should all understand that  CMON  updated  rules  (or 'Seasons') are static until the end of the Campaign and participants should not update their cards or rules mid-campaign unless there is direction  to  do  so  from  the  Campaign  Organizer. Likewise  new units/boxes released by CMON mid-campaign should be evaluated for play by the Campaign Organizer and Referees prior to authorized use.

## Referee Duty & Documentation

A large amount of information must be logged during Council Phase, Challenge  Phase, and  each  battle in order for  the  Milestone Campaign League to function.  App support is a long-term goal for this  project  to  cut  down  on  the  demand  in  this  regard.    In  the meantime,  it  is  highly  recommended  that  you  frequently  take pictures  or  video  of  your  games  as  you  proceed  so  that  you  can consult  those  records  if  something  is  missed  in  documentation. Assign dedicated Scribes.

It  is  critical  that  there  is  documented  distinction  between  when battles are 'fought' versus when they are 'resolved'.  Several game mechanics trigger as a result of battles being 'fought', meaning two or more players actually sat down, made armies, and played the war game for some amount of time.  Players should be disallowed from intentionally  setting  up  battles  just  to  gain  some  value  (such  as Veterancy)  without  actually  intending  to compete  in  the  battle. During Challenge Phase, if players do not intend to compete in, but rather  exploit  the  Campaign  mechanics  by  colluding  with  another faction  to  simply  generate  Might  by  accepting  Draws  or  Close Defeats, they should be disallowed from doing so.

Battles that are 'resolved' before the players even begin to play may be legal if both Factions had initiated their Challenges/Skirmishes in earnest, but later determined that it was preferable to not play the battle.  In such cases the involved parties do not create army lists.  No Characters  other  than  the  involved  Commanders  may  trigger  any Character Traits as a result of such a resolution.

Referees should take proper 'canonical considerations' when making rulings.  While some canonical elements of the Ice and Fire universe were tweaked for gamification in this material (Targaryens have full military strength so early; Skagos being considered Beyond the Wall; etc.) it is still a good guide to heed the lore.  If a questionable game action on the part of a player seems wildly out of alignment with what a canonical Faction Leader should do (e.g. repeatedly sending their armies to slaughter to boost the Might Rank of another Faction) then they should be disallowed from doing it.

Note  that  even  though  MCL  may  be  played  as  a  team  game, spectators  shall  not  provide  coaching  or  advice  in  battles  unless requested to act in that capacity by all involved players.

## Might Makes Right

Due to the complexity of this system, there are numerous disputes which are likely to arise between factions.   A good rule for Referees to use when settling matters that are not detailed in these instructions is: "Might Makes Right" - the involved player who holds the highest Might Rank determines the outcome.

## Example 1:

During Challenge Phase the Lannisters Challenge a Region held by the Starks and the Starks Counter Challenge with a Commander of their own. The Boltons offer a Commander to aid the Lannisters and the Lannisters accept their aid. Both the Baratheons and Targaryens insist on aiding the Starks and a dispute arises. Since the Targaryens are a higher Might Rank (1) than the Baratheons (2), the Targaryens should supersede  and  overrule  the  Baratheons,  excluding  them  from  the battle. In a scenario where the Starks have a higher Might Rank than both prospective allies, the Starks should be allowed to choose who aids them.

## Example 2:

During Battle Phase the Greyjoys are preparing to play two Challenge Battles: against the Starks at the White Knife and against the Boltons in the  Bite. They  intend  to  encircle  and  Vanquish  the  Stark Commander at the White Knife but first must first defeat the Bolton Commander  in  the  Bite.    Otherwise,  he  will  provide  a  Protected Withdraw for the Starks if left in place. Comparing the Might Ranks of all factions participating in both battles, the highest Might Rank faction participating in either battle should determine the order in which the battles occur. (Referees should insist that no player uses such  an  advantage  to  exploit  their  opponents'  real  life  scheduling restrictions.)

## Glossary

[UNIT OR ATTACHMENT] +1 - Indicates an army list size bonus that allows the player to add +1 to their army size when including that unit. Unless  otherwise  stated,  multiple  of  these  bonuses  may  be applied to a single unit deployed in your army, however each bonus may only be applied once per battle.

Available  -  A  character  is  Available  when  they  are  not  Injured, Captured, or Killed and are not geographically prohibited from acting in the Region where relevant effects are occurring.

Capital - A Region which holds supremacy over a Realm, generating +1 Might at the start of the Month.

Capture/Captive  -  Characters  held  by  an  opposing  Faction  and unavailable  to  their  own  Faction.    Usually  resulting  from  passing  a Death Save after a defeat and then failing the subsequent Capture Save.

Challenge - When a Commander is put forth onto the Campaign Map from Reserve, or their prior location, onto a Region, assisting or asserting a "must play" battle for the Month.  Challenge battles not fought  by  this  Commander's  Faction  result  in  this  Commander becoming automatically  Injured  and  grant  the  opposing  Faction  a Total Victory.  If no Faction opposes a Challenge during Challenge Phase,  that  Faction  may  choose  a  Challenge  Result  which  occurs immediately.  The Challenge is then refunded to the Faction (e.g. if it was the Faction's first Challenge of the phase, that Faction still has two Challenges left to put forth.  The rolled Event may not be re-rolled.)

- Protection  Challenge  -  Once  per  Month  on  a  Faction's  turn  to declare a Challenge, that Faction may set aside one Commander and declare them for a Protection Challenge. This reserves one of the Faction's Challenges. That Commander may then be placed on  the  map  later  to  counter  one  hostile  Challenge  to  a  Region owned by his Faction.  Commanders are still subject to location restrictions  if  they  appeared  on  the  map  in  a  non-Commander version the prior Month.  Commanders set aside in a Protection Challenge may be put forth later in an Intercept Challenge.
- Intercept Challenge - Place a Commander who is able to be put forth in a Challenge in a Region that interrupts the declared path of a hostile Commander moving through that Region on their way to another Challenge or Skirmish. The Intercept Region may not be  the  Region  in  which  the  target  Commander  started  their movement, nor the destination Region of that intended movement.    Intercepts  may  not  occur  in  Regions  owned  by  a Faction  which  does  not  consent  to  the  Intercept  or  Regions containing a Commander of a Faction which does not consent to the  Intercept.    Commanders  initiating  an  Interception  must declare their own path to the interception and may be Intercepted themselves. In such cases, resolve the newest Intercept Challenge first, then acknowledge that the original target of Interception was not Intercepted (and may not be Intercepted again on their path to the original Challenge). Then resolve that original Challenge.

Challenge Result - A special effect that may be selected when a player wins a battle that was a Challenge battle for their Faction. (p28)

Character - A fictional named person who may perform actions on behalf  of  a  Faction  as  one  or  more  of  the  following  versions: Commander, Attachment, NCU, or Solo.

Coin - A number representing the economic acquisition power of a Faction.    Tradable  currency  used  to  buy  Developments or  Neutral units, ransom prisoners, or generally deal with other factions.

Conquer - A Challenge Result that allows a Faction to take control of a Region where the battle was fought for a default cost of -2 Might or -4 Coin. (p28)

Dead/Killed - Characters who are out of play for the remainder of the Campaign.  Usually resulting from failing a Death Save at the end of a battle.

Development - An unlockable upgrade for a Region, representing a Faction's investment  in  a  major  regional  landmark.    Generally purchased by the Region's owner for -1 Coin during Council Phase or -3 Coin if it has been Sacked.

Event  -  One  of  20  special  circumstances  applicable  to  a  single Challenge battle in a single (or specified) Region.  Determined by a d20  roll,  and  subsequently  ineligible  to  be  triggered  again  for  the remainder of Challenge Phase. (p17)

Faction - One of ten collections of Characters, units, resources, etc. controlled by a Faction Leader.

Faction Leader - The one player per Faction who has final, overriding authority over game decisions for that faction.

Injured - A Character suffered substantial harm, causing them to be unavailable for use for the remainder of the Month.  Usually a result of being Attached to a Combat Unit that was off the battlefield at the end of the battle. At the end of the Month following the Month they became Injured. Injured Characters are placed into Reserve.

Might - A score representing a Faction's ability to project military force in Westeros.  Used to determine Might Rank.

Might Rank - Determined at the start of each Month, the number from  1  to  10,  unique  to  each  Faction,  representing  the  Faction's relative standing in Might.

Range - A (1) to (3) value that indicates how many Sea Regions may be  traversed  in  a  single  Month  by  a  Character  utilizing  a  Region's Dock.

Realm - A set of adjacent Regions, including a Capital (except for the Realm "Beyond the Wall" which has no Capital).

Recall - An action that may be declared during Council Phase when a  Faction  declares  a  Commander  and  resets  their  Campaign  Map location, placing them in Reserve.  That Character may now appear in battle anywhere on the Campaign Map; however, they may not be used as their Commander version for the remainder of the Month.

Region - A delineated section of the map that may be controlled by a  Faction  and  may  be  the  site  of  one  battle  per  Month.    Regions generate +1 Might by default and generally contain a Development.

Reserve - Commanders who are not on the Campaign map and are not Injured, Captured, or Dead.

Rout - A Challenge Result that allows a Faction to immediately take control of the adjacent Region through which an attacking Commander traversed to arrive at this battle Region (connected by passable land), and any unlocked Developments there unless such Developments are held by the Brotherhood.

Sack  -  A  Challenge  Result  that  allows  a  Faction  to  destroy  the Development  in  that  Region  and  gain  +2  Coin  via  the  Challenge result.  They should be marked as Sacked on the Map Details Page (black background).

Save - A d6 roll used to determine if a Character is Injured, Dead, or Captured, usually at the conclusion of a battle.  Saves are failed on a roll of 1 by default and modifiers may never allow a 1 to pass.  A roll of 6 is never a failure regardless of modifiers.

Secure  -  A  Challenge  Result  that  allows  a  Faction  to  immediately unlock  a  Development  in  the  battle  Region,  even  if  it  has  been Sacked, or gain +2 Coin if its Development is already unlocked.

Skirmish - Put forth a Commander onto the Campaign Map from Reserve or move a Commander onto a Region, assisting or asserting an optional battle for the Month.  Skirmish battles not fought by this Commander's  faction  do  not  result  in  the  Commander  being automatically  Injured.    If  occurring  on  this  player's  turn  (not  in response to another player's Challenge or Skirmish) Skirmishes may only be put forth if both of this Faction's Challenges have already been declared by this player.

Vanquish - A Commander who does not have an eligible Region for Withdraw after a battle immediately rolls a Capture Save.  On failure, they  are  Captured  by  a  hostile  faction  controlling  a  Region  or possessing a Commander where the defeated Commander Withdrew.  On success, they become automatically Injured.

Withdraw - After the resolution of a battle, Commanders who were Defeated  but  not  Injured,  Captured,  or  Killed  must  move  to  an adjacent Region which does not contain a Commander from a faction which objects to that movement. Commanders may Withdraw from a land Region to a Sea Region only if the battle Region's Dock was controlled by  the  Withdrawing  Commander's  Faction prior  to  the battle.

- Protected Withdraw - An exception to the normal Withdraw rule when a Commander Withdraws into a Region which contains both a Commander from a faction which objects to that movement and a Commander from a faction (including the Withdrawing Commander's own faction) who consents to the movement. In this movement the withdrawing Commander moves through the contested Region to a subsequent adjacent Region in which there are no hostile Commanders. At the start of the following Month, this Withdrawing.

## Character Location - General

Named  Characters  and  units  are  unique  and,  although  they  may appear in different versions (e.g., Robb Stark - "The Wolf Lord" and Robb Stark -"The Young Wolf") they represent single persons. Characters who have the same name and title but appear in different Factions (such as Daario Naharis) count as different versions of the same Character.  Once a Character is placed on the board as a Commander version, or takes part in any battle as another version, those  versions  of  that  Character  may  not  be  used  again  for  the remainder of the Month.  Any other versions of that Character may only be used in:

- The  same  Realm  (connected  by  land  in  the  case  of Commander movement)
- Or one Region adjacent to that Realm
- Or one Region within Range of a friendly Dock in that Realm for the remainder of the Month.

At the start of a new Month, all Characters shall be considered to be in  the  Region  where  they  participated  in  any  of  the  actions  listed above during the previous Month.  If they are a Commander who is not in Reserve but did not participate in any of the actions above, they  remain  in  the  Region  where  they  were  last  placed  during Challenge Phase. Commander miniatures should be moved/removed during the subsequent Challenge Phase to reflect this.

Characters who begin a Month in a Sea Region may treat any Realm adjacent to that Sea Region as their starting Realm for that Month but if they move from sea to land, they may not return to sea in the same Month unless performing an otherwise legal Withdraw. Characters may also Challenge or Skirmish from any Sea Region to one adjacent Sea Region.

Greyjoy Iron  Fleet  Captains  and  the  Commander  bearing  the  title 'Master of Ships' are allowed exceptions to these rules, see Strategy Sheets and Character Traits sheets for details.

Characters participating in (20) Lavish Tourney or Trial by Combat are also  bound  by  these  rules  although  the  versions  of  the  Character declared for use in those activities may still be used in one battle that Month.

Note that when a character has multiple Commander versions on the board  at  the  same  time,  their  Faction  may  be  limited  in  which directions  one  version  may  be  able  to  Withdraw  after  a  Defeat because they still need to be able to reach the location of the second battle  for  which  they  are  scheduled  later  that  Month. Individual versions may not Withdraw in any manner that would cause them to violate the location rules as explained  above. This  means  a Commander may sometimes be Vanquished even if it appears they are not totally surrounded.

## Example 1:

Tyrion  Lannister  -  "Halfman"  may  be  placed  on  the  board  as  a Commander Challenging a battle for control of Ashemark (Region) in the  Westerlands  (Realm). If  he  is  not  Injured,  Killed,  or  Captured during that battle, Tyrion Lannister - "The Giant of Lannister" may be played as an Attachment in an army Commanded by Jaime Lannister in another Challenge battle in Crakehall (Region) in the Westerlands (Realm) later that Month. If he is still available after both, he could appear as Tyrion Lannister - "The Imp", an NCU supporting an army under  the  command  of  Tywin  Lannister  in  a  Skirmish  battle  in Northmarch (Region) which is adjacent to the Westerlands (Realm).

## Example 2:

Stannis Baratheon - "The Rightful Heir" may be placed on the board as a Commander countering a Challenge to Cape Wrath (Region) in the Stormlands (Realm). During the same Challenge Phase, Stannis Baratheon - "The One True King" may also be placed on the board to Challenge the Dornish Marches (Region) in the Stormlands (Realm) and Stannis Baratheon - "King at the Wall" in a Skirmish in Broken Arm (Region) in Dorne(Realm) because both of those locations are legally accessible from the first location he was played if he has access to the friendly Dock at Cape Wrath. However, if Stannis were to be Injured, Killed,  or  Captured during the battle at  Cape Wrath, he would no longer be able to deploy in either remaining battle and the Baratheon player would have to replace him with 1 Commander from Reserve or forfeit each battle as a Total Defeat.

Before  starting  Council  and  Challenge  Phases,  it  is  important  that each  player  understands  how  to  place  their  Commanders  on  the Campaign  Map  and  how  to  move  them  using  Challenges  or Skirmishes.

Each player begins the Month with all their available Commanders in Reserve  (off  the  map)  or  in  whichever  Region  they  last  were  last participated in any Challenge/Skirmish, Tourney, or Trial on the map. Remove any other versions of those Commanders from the map and set them aside.   Remember that Commanders who were in Reserve but performed other actions the previous Month (acting as an NCU, Attachment, Solo, Lavish Tourney  competitor,  or  Trial  by  Combat Champion) are still bound by normal location restrictions and their Commander miniatures now must be placed onto the map.

Each  player  has  two  Challenges  and  a  great  number  of  available Skirmishes (limited only by their number of available Commanders) per Month. When a player performs a Challenge, they will start by rolling for an Event.  Then place a chosen Commander on a Region as part of that Challenge. If a Commander is coming from Reserve, they must start the Challenge by moving from a Region owned by their Faction  and  Challenge  into  the  target  Region  (except  in  Month  1 when  he  may  start  in  any  Region  other  than  the  target  Region). Whenever a Commander moves on the map, players must declare the route, Region by Region, which their Commander uses to move to their destination.  Commanders may not route through Regions containing a hostile Commander unless that Region also contains a Commander from a consenting Faction who is engaged in a Challenge or Skirmish there that was triggered the same Month.

If a Commander Challenges after they were already on the map, roll for an Event as usual.  Then move to a Region within the same Realm in  which  he  began  that  Month  or  1  Region  adjacent  to  that Realm. Commanders may also move through 1 friendly accessible Dock in that Realm to any Region within that Dock's Range.  (Same rules outlined in the previous section.)

If a Commander traverses any Region held by another faction or any Region  occupied  by,  or  accessible  to,  an  enemy  Commander,  an opposing  Faction  may  declare  that  they  are  Intercepting  that Commander.  A hostile Commander is placed on the map in a target Region along the original route halting the original Commander there and initiating an Intercept Challenge with the new Commander.

After a Faction has put forth both of its Challenges for the Month (by initiating, countering, Intercepting, or declaring Protection Challenge) that Faction may continue to participate throughout the turn  cycle  by  placing  any  number  of  the  rest  of  their  available Commanders on the board in Skirmishes.  See Challenge Phase for a step-by-step explanation of this process.

## Example 1:

At the start of Month 2, Greatjon Umber is on the map in The White Knife where he won a Skirmish battle and was not Injured in Month 1. He may be sent to Challenge the Crossing because it is a Region adjacent to the Realm (the North) where he began this Month. If the Boltons hold the Neck, they may Intercept Challenge him, causing him to stop and fight them in the field there, without reaching the Crossing. If the Starks have access to the White Harbor Development with Dock (3), Greatjon might have instead Challenged The Fingers because Dock (1) allows The Bite to be traversable. If  the Greyjoys had an Iron Fleet in the The Bite, they would be able to Intercept Challenge him at sea.  (Only one of these may occur.)

Example 2:

The Great Walrus began Month 3 in Reserve. He may Challenge the Region of Bear Island by starting in the Free Folk controlled Region of Frozen  Shore  with  access  to  the  Dock  (1)  in  the  Lorn  Point Development to move across the Bay of Ice.

## Reading the Map

- Realms, Regions, Developments - Delineated on the map.  See Glossary.
- Owner - The Faction currently in control of the Region and/or Development (may be split if Brotherhood controls the Development)
- Region Perks - Bonuses granted to the Faction controlling this Region.  Army list size bonuses also only apply to battles fought in this Region.
- Development Perks - Bonuses granted to the Faction controlling this Development after it has been unlocked and not Sacked (or from the start of the Campaign if labeled 'START').  Army list size bonuses also only apply to battles fought in this Region.
- Castles & Terrain - Specific Castle Walls to be placed using cards from Break  the  Siege  or Attack  the  Vale  supplements  during battles.    See  Castle  Reference.  Other  terrain  pieces  listed  here must be placed first by participants before any chosen terrain types are placed.  Restricted terrain types are also listed here.
- Map Type - Description dimensions of the battlefield and the number and orientation of Objective markers to be placed.
- Open Field - 5 Objective markers in a standard Game of Thrones layout.  The map dimensions are 4'x4'.
- Mountain Pass - 1 center token with 1 token 12' toward each  Deployment Zone.  The map dimensions are 3' wide by 4' deep.
- Coastal Assault - 1 center token flanked by 1 token on either  side,  6'  from  the  Flank  T able  Edges.    The  map dimensions are 4' wide by 3' deep.

Note: If smaller map dimensions cause players to not be able to fit all their Combat Unit trays inside of the Deployment Zone at the start of the battle, leave those extra units off the board until the game  has  begun  and  units  have  begun  to  move  out  of  the Deployment Zone.  Then place the extra units at the back of the Deployment Zone against the Friendly table edge immediately as space becomes available.

- Commander Perks - Army list size bonuses applicable to certain Characters when they are being deployed as a Commander in this Region.  These apply even if the Commander's Faction is not in control of the Region.

## Month 1 Special Rules

King Robert Baratheon is dead!  The lands of Westeros are about to break into an all-out war for the Iron Throne.

At the outset of the coming war, the following special rules are set for Month 1:

- All Commanders except for Targaryen Commanders may be placed  anywhere  on  the  map  during  Month  1  Challenge Phase without having to come from Reserve into a Region owned by their Faction.  Simply declare a Region that your Commander being in, placing them on the Campaign Map. Then  move  them  to  one  adjacent  Region  and  declare  a Challenge or Skirmish there.
- Targaryen Commanders may be placed on any Sea Region at the start of a Challenge or Skirmish this Month.  Then move them  to  one  adjacent  Region  and  declare  a  Challenge  or Skirmish there.
- Challenges  or  Skirmishes  may  not  be  made  in  Capitals (including Dragonstone and King's Landing), Frostfangs, the Dreadfort,  or  Blackwater  Rush  this  Month.    Defeated Commanders may not Withdraw into those Regions unless the Withdrawing Commander's Faction controls that Region this Month.

## Month 1 Starting Might & Coin

Note:  All Might and Coin values and the sources from which they are gained or lost are public knowledge, declared by participants  when  they  change,  and  readily  available  for  review  by  any  participant  with  the  sole  exception  of  House Lannister's current total Coin.  Additional Lannister Coin is added by a d6 roll as outlined on the Lannister Strategy Sheet and may be kept secret along with their total current Coin by obscuring that field on the Lannister Strategy Sheet Log with a sticky note or some other means.  This value may only be revealed by the Lannister Faction Leader or reported to a Referee for validation.

## Council Phase Sequence

The  Council  Phase  begins  when  all  Faction  Leaders  or  their designated  representatives  are  present  and  ready  to  begin.    All Factions  must  declare  any  'end  of  Month'  effects  which  were triggered  at  the  end  of  the  previous  Month.    All  Factions  then declare  any  'start  of  Month'  effects  triggered  for  the  current Month.

## All Factions then tally all Might gained or lost from:

- Capitals they control (+1 Might each)
- Regions they control (+1 Might each)
- Region and Development Perks
- Battle Defeat or Victory Effects
- Strategy Sheets and any other special effects
- Captured Characters held (p28)

## All Factions then tally all Coin gained or lost from:

- Region and Development Perks
- Sacks
- Strategy Sheets and any other special effects

## All  Factions  then  determine  the  Might  Ranking  for  the  entire Month:

- By total cumulative Might
- Tie broken by Coin (Lannisters must reveal their current total Coin or lose any ties)
- Further ties broken by total number of Victories
- Further ties broken by d6 rolls

After  the  Might  Ranking  has  been  established.    Factions  may perform the following actions in any order, declaring all relevant actions to the whole table as they are performed.   Referees should control the pace to ensure that all players have opportunities to speak, be heard, and react to circumstances as they occur:

- All Factions may declare and pay (-1 Coin) to unlock any number of Developments in Regions they control where there is no hostile Commander present.
- The  Iron  Throne  Faction  must  negotiate  the  Small Council seats.  Default Characters occupying those seats at the start of Month 1 are:
- King of the Seven Kingdoms - Joffrey Baratheon
- Hand of the King - Eddard Stark
- Grandmaester - Pycelle
- Master of Coin - Petyr Baelish
- Master of Laws - Renly Baratheon
- Master of Ships - Stannis Baratheon
- Master of Whisperers - Varys
- Lord  Commander  of  the  Kingsguard  -  Barristan Selmy
- House  Baratheon  must  designate  Declared  Realms  for Stannis and Renly and announce which brother has the Greater Claim for the current Month.
- House Bolton must declare the current tallies of Schemes for each of the Bolton Commanders.
- Brotherhood without Banners must declare King's Justice and facilitate a Trial by Combat if they wish to do so on behalf of one Captured Character.
- Free  Folk  must  reveal  the  current  state  of  the  Horde United.    (Placing  the  Commander  miniatures  on  the Motivation T racks and photographing the Strategy Sheet is a good way to document this.)
- House  Greyjoy  having  declared  new  Iron  Fleets  at  the Start of the Month must declare the current state of all Iron Fleets.  They must declare any alterations they make to the composition of the Iron Fleets during the rest of Council Phase.
- House Lannister, having declared any Power Plays triggered at the end of the previous Month.  They may declare Flaunted Wealth at any time they wish to do so (before or after the Might Ranking is established).  They must facilitate the auction of available Neutral Characters using  the  Neutral  Character  Traits  sheet.    They  must declare any effects from the Power of Coin.
- House  Martell  must  declare  any  Factions  who  are targeted by Prince's Intrigues and declare the start of any new Intrigues as they occur.
- Night's Watch must negotiate for any contributions to the  Wall.    They  must  declare  the  restoration  of  any Abandoned Castle at the Wall and the -1 Might cost paid by themselves or any other Faction.
- House Stark, having declared any Sacrifices they triggered at the end of the previous Month or Retributions they triggered at the start of the current Month.
- House Targaryen must declare their War Focus for the current  Month  and  any  Regions  they  gained  through Revealed Loyalists.
- All Factions must declare if they wish to recall any Commanders, moving them from the Campaign Map into Reserve and preventing them from being deployed as Commanders until the following Month.  (Those Characters may still participate in battles or other actions as long as they are not doing so as their Commander version and are still subject to normal location restrictions.)

## Diplomacy & Trade

Factions are expected to participate in diplomatic talks through all phases  of  the  Campaign  in  attempts  to  improve  conditions  to their  own  ends.    The  following  exchanges  may  occur  on  the authority of Faction Leaders and must be officially declared and documented for all participants to see.

Coin exchanges may occur at any time during the Campaign at the direction of the Faction giving Coin.

Captive  exchanges  may  occur  between  a  Faction  holding  a Captured Character and another Faction if both agree.  A Faction may  also  release  a  Captured  Character  back  to  their  original Faction.  This may occur at any time during the Campaign unless the  Brotherhood  Without  Banners  has  declared  that  Captured Character as the subject for a Trial by Combat, at which point no exchange may occur until that Trial is resolved.

Region exchanges may occur only during Council Phase after the Might Ranking is established.  Each faction may give or receive control of only one Region per Month, but the receiving Faction must control a Region adjacent to the Region being exchanged. Any unlocked Developments controlled by the original Faction in the exchanged Region remain unlocked for the new controlling Faction.  The Brotherhood may receive control of Developments anywhere  but  may  only  give  control  of  Developments  to  the Faction holding the associated Region.

These exchanges may accompany verbal agreements of any kind, such  as  promises  not  to  invade  certain  territory.    But  always remember verbal agreements are not enforced by the rules - trust no one!

## Optional Rule - Logistic Phase

Pioneered by MCL Quebec, Logistic Phase is an optional rule that creates a period of time between Council and Challenge Phases:

Players build their army lists using all available bonuses, Region Perks, Development Perks and Strategy Sheet bonuses. Factions will also need to decide in what order they would want to have the battle occur in order to plan for Withdraw. Once the  Logistic  Phase  is  complete,  the  lists  will  be  shared  with every Faction, and a table will be built of the order of battles. The order of battles will follow the 'Might Makes Right'' rule.

Addendum to the Character Death: If a Character is Injured or Killed as a result of a combat, this Death' will be announced at the  end  of  the  Month  instead  of  immediately.  This  allows players  to  use  all  versions  of  a  Character  during  a  Month without needing to re-construct army lists.

## Challenge Phase Sequence

The  Challenge  Phase  consists  primarily  of  each  Faction  putting forth  two  Challenges  which  are  'must  play'  battles. Failure  to participate in such battles counts as a Total Defeat for the absent faction and results in automatic Injury to the involved Commander.

There are two special types of Challenges: Intercept Challenges and Protection Challenges.  Review their definitions and uses in the Glossary on page 6.

Factions may also put forth any number of Skirmishes (as long as they  still  have  Commanders  to  place  on  the  board)  which  are optional battles.  If a Faction declines to fight a Skirmish they may Withdraw their Commander without being automatically Injured but still may be Vanquished.  Their opponents who Challenged or Skirmished  gain  a  Total  Victory.    If  the  decision  to  decline  the battle was shared by both opposing Skirmishers, both Commanders Withdraw and no Might is gained.

The turn order for Challenge Phase begins with the lowest Might Rank Faction, ascends to the highest Might Rank Faction, which gets a double turn, then descends back to the lowest Might Rank Faction, which gets a double turn.  This 'snake' pattern continues until  all  have  first  expended  both  Challenges,  and  then  any number  of  Skirmishes  they  wish  to  put  forth  from  remaining Commanders.

Before putting forth any Commander in a Challenge, the player must  roll  a  d20  and  consult  the  Events  sheet  or  Core  Rules  to determine which Event they have triggered, declaring it to the rest of the players.  The lowest Might Rank Flayer may choose their Event instead of rolling and Events may not be triggered more than once  per  Month  unless  otherwise  noted.    If  all  Events  have occurred, stop rolling for Events before each Challenge.

When performing a Challenge or Skirmish, declare a target Region or Protective Challenge and move a Commander from any Region you control (if coming from Reserve), or wherever they last acted on the map, to that Region.  Declare the route as the Commander moves  so  that  all  players  know  every  Region  traversed  and Intercept Challenges may be declared.  Each Region may only be the  site  of  one  battle  per  Month,  except  the  Eyrie  (see  Castle Reference).    If  any  other  Faction's  Commander  was  already present in that Region, that Faction must immediately put that Commander forth in response to the original move, or Withdraw. If  they  are  not  put  forth  and  do  not  Withdraw,  they  are Vanquished.

- If a neutral Region was targeted - any eligible player may spend a Challenge or Skirmish to contest the Region (with priority given to Challenge over Skirmish, or Might Rank if both candidates are putting forth the same type).
- If a hostile Region was targeted - the owner of that Region may  first  determine  if  they  wish  to  defend  it  with  a Challenge or a Skirmish before other Factions have the option to respond.
- Determine  Team  Battle  -  if  each  side  has  two  willing participants contributing Commanders, or if two Commanders  from  allied  Factions  Challenge  against  a single  enemy  Commander,  a  Team  Battle  occurs.    To determine if a Team Battle may be refused and how to resolve Challenges and Skirmishes for 2v2 or 2v1 Matchups, refer to page 19.
- Determine  Castle  -  players  must  consult  the  Castle Reference found on the Map Details - South sheet and determine  whether  a  Break  the  Siege  battle  will  take place.  If so, declare which Castle will be used.

Document  all  forthcoming  battles  using  the  Challenge  Log. Continue ascending and descending turns until no Factions have the ability or desire to put  forth  further  Skirmishes  (both Challenges must put forth, even if one was wasted on a Protective Challenge  that  was  never  triggered  by  an  opponent).    Factions must put forth both Challenges before putting forth any Skirmishes  on  their  own  turn.  However,  Factions  may  spend Skirmishes at any time in response to another player putting forth a Challenge or Skirmish.

## Optional Rule - Timed Challenge

Campaign Organizers may choose to implement the optional rule of a Timed Challenge Phase.  Under this system each Faction has a set amount of time (recommended 3 minutes) to fully declare their Challenge or Skirmish.  Referees should pause the timer if (20) Grand Tourney is rolled or if there is a complicated rules question. If the time expires, the Challenge is expended.  If the Faction was putting forth a Skirmish, that Skirmish is expended and the Faction may only put forth Skirmishes in response to other Factions for the duration of the Phase.

## Skirmish, Withdraw, & Vanquish

Players may find that following through on playing out Skirmish battles is not worth the risk of fielding their valuable Characters. In  some  cases  this  may  certainly  be  true,  but  players  should consider strategic uses of Skirmishing to further their goals.

One such strategy,  'Skirmish  Marching',  refers  to  performing  a Skirmish with a Commander for the primary purpose of moving them to a new Realm to set up another movement the following Month.    It  should  be  noted  that  for  this  strategy  to  have  its intended effect, the resolution of this Skirmish battle must be the final action this Character performs in the Month, otherwise the Character's location restriction still ties them to the prior Realm where they last acted.

Another  strategy  is  'Skirmish  Blocking'.  Factions  may  be  more inclined to deploy their Commanders by Skirmishing in Regions surrounding  a  critical Challenge  battle,  thereby  limiting  the opposing Commander's Withdrawal options or forcing a Vanquish. In  such cases opposing Factions may Skirmish in the same  Region,  each  trying  to  encircle  the  other  to  limit  enemy Withdraw  options  in  case  of  a  Victory  or  provide  a  Protected Withdraw  option  in  case  of  Defeat. If  both  Factions  agree  to playing  the  Skirmish  battle  before  the  Challenge,  the  Skirmish battle  is  fought  and  the  loser  Withdraws  their  Commander  as normal prior to the Challenge battle. If neither of the Skirmishing factions is confident enough to proceed with the Skirmish battle prior  to  the  Challenge  battle,  then  both  Factions'  Skirmishing Commanders  provide for the opportunity of a Protected Withdraw (see Glossary).

Withdraw occurs when a defeated Commander (who is Injured, Captured, or Killed) moves to an adjacent Region which does not contain  a  Commander  from  a  faction  which  objects  to  that movement. Commanders may Withdraw from a land Region to a Sea Region only if the battle Region's Dock was controlled by the Withdrawing  Commander's  Faction  prior  to  the  battle.    A Commander may not Withdraw through a Dock from one land Region to another Land Region.

Protected Withdraw is an exception to the normal Withdraw rule when  a  Commander  Withdraws  into  a  Region  which  contains both  a  Commander  from  a  faction  which  objects  to  that movement  and  a  Commander  from  a  faction  (including  the Withdrawing  Commander's  own  faction)  who  consents  to  the movement. In  this  movement  the  withdrawing  Commander moves through the contested Region to a subsequent adjacent Region in which there are no hostile Commanders. At the start of the following Month, this Withdrawing.

A Vanquish occurs when a Commander who does not have an eligible Region for Withdraw.  That Commander immediately rolls a  Capture Save and suffers -4 to their roll.  On failure, they are Captured by a hostile faction controlling a Region or possessing a Commander  where  the  defeated  Commander  Withdrew.    On success, they become automatically Injured.

## Events

Each Event may only be gained once per Month unless they were acquired by a special effect. The lowest Might Rank Faction may select any Event which has not yet been rolled this Month when it is their turn to put forth a Challenge.  For all other Factions, Roll a d20 to determine the Event, re-rolling if that number has already been  taken. (Players  may  also  switch  to  a  smaller  die  if  fewer options remain.)  Assign one Referee to logging which Events have been  rolled  and  stop  rolling  for  Events  when  all  20  have  been triggered.  Some Character Traits may allow a Faction to select an alternate Event after they have rolled.  In such cases, that Event may be used even if it was already rolled prior.  If that Event had not yet been rolled, it may now no longer be rolled during this Month.

## (20) Lavish Tourney

Your nobles insist that a tournament must be hosted locally to improve commerce. Jousting and grand melees never fail to draw a crowd in Westeros. Even wartime rivals sometimes sneak into the lists to compete against each other for glory.

Announce  a  tournament  in  one  of  your  Regions  or  a  Region owned by a consenting Faction. All Factions may contribute one Commander or one Character Attachment who is eligible to be in that Region during this Month. Declare the Character and version being used.  Involved players each roll a d6. Commanders add +2 to their roll and 2-point Attachments add +1 to their roll. Characters who roll a 3 or less (after modifier) are Injured and out of the tourney. Players with remaining Characters continue to roll off against each other until one player has a higher roll than all remaining competitors. That competitor earns +2 Might and +1 Coin. Players  whose  Characters  were  not  Injured  earn  +1 Might. Characters who were not Injured may still be used in other actions and battles (including their versions used in this tourney) but  are  still  subject  to  normal  location  restrictions  from  the tourney Region. The Faction owning the Region that hosted the tourney gains +2 Coin.

## (19) A Flesh Wound

A Hero has miraculously shrugged off what should have been a fatal blow.

One of your Injured characters is no longer injured or one of your named Characters may re-roll their Death Save for this battle.

## (18) Raiding Party

One of your captains has volunteered to lead a sortie of assailants behind enemy lines prior to battle to plunder supplies.

If your Commander moves to an enemy Controlled Region, you may  immediately  steal  1  Coin  from  the  Controlling  Player's stockpile.

## (17) Construction Boon

While your soldiery fights on the front lines, your citizenry feels safe to prosper at home.

One of your controlled Regions gains a free Development. If none are eligible, gain +1 Coin.

## (16) Keen Scouting

Your swiftest scouts have reported back with exact locations of enemy troops who were woefully unaware.

Opponents in this battle must deploy all of their army before you deploy any units and you automatically choose First Player, even if you also win the roll for choosing table side.

## (15) Sequester Foe

A  key  antagonist  has  been  identified  by  your  spies. They manufacture political emergencies to make sure that troublemaker will not arrive for the next battle.

After the opponents' Commanders are declared you may name any other Character available to be fielded by those enemies, they may not field that Character in any form during the battle.  (When a  Character  T rait  that  would  force  a  Faction  to  include  that character  in  an  army,  that  Character  is  not  immune  from  the effects of this Event and could still be forced to be absent from the battle, even though the campaign effect of their T rait remains.)

## (14) Land Grab

Having marched in force and eager for battle, your troops are still surprisingly fresh and eager to move again should you decide to press on.

If  a  Commander takes control of a Region without a battle this turn and has their Challenge refunded, that Commander may be used to make another Challenge in the same Realm this Month.

## (13) Auxiliary Masons

Among  your  army's  camp  followers  are  a  crew  of  traveling stonemasons eager to work their trade for your cause.

If a friendly Commander Conquers or Routs after this battle, he may  immediately  Develop  this  Region  or  an  adjacent  Region owned by a friendly faction for free.

## (12) Elite Mercenary Contacts

Your  steward  reports  a  renowned  mercenary  company  has expressed  mutual  interest  in  your  war  effort  and  offered  a discount for their services.

Reduce the cost of mercenaries for yourself and your ally by 2 Coin (each) for this battle.

## (11) Agitated Rebellion

Word of your exploits in the coming battle will spread quickly and could inspire nearby commonfolk to rise up against their current lord.

If you win a battle or take Control of a Region you may select 1 adjacent enemy Region, that Region generates no Might or Coin.

## (10) Plentiful Leadership

Two of your Commanders have devised a unique strategy they wish to employ in the coming battle.

You  may  Challenge  using  2  Commanders  in  the  same  region, deploying them in the same army, and using 1 of each of their Tactics cards to complete your deck of 20.

## (9) Clever Ruse

Your  Commanders  have  hatched  a  plan  to  displace  a  sizable enemy  force.  This  diversion  could  cause  your  enemies  to  be spread thin.

After  an  enemy  counters  your  Challenge  you  may  return  your Commander to Reserve. The enemy Commander remains in that Region. The  enemy  is  refunded  their  spent  Challenge  if  they counter Challenged when this effect occurs.

## (8) Lying in Wait

Your vanguard has spotted terrain that could be used to surprise the enemy with a flanking maneuver during the battle.

One unit fielded by you or your ally in this battle Outflank for free.

## (7) Downed Ravens

The finest marksmen in your company have downed a number of ravens carry messages between enemy positions.

The  first  three  Tactics  cards  drawn  by  your  opponent  must  be revealed to you at the start of Round 1 during this battle. In a team battle, you choose which opponent.

## (6) All or Nothing

The  soldiers  of  this  army  have  an  undying  devotion  to  their Commander  and  many  will  sacrifice  themselves  for  the  cause rather than retreat from a losing battle.

You gain +1 Might from Victory on this Challenge but gain no Might from Draw or Close Defeat.

## (5) Lure the Garrison

The  enemy's  garrisoned  troops  in  this  Region  are  restless  and arrogant. They could easily be coaxed to sally out and meet you in the field.

You  may  choose  to  prevent  your  enemy  from  using  a  Castle, forcing a Field Battle rather than Break the Siege in this Region.

## (4) Local Sellswords

A  local  inn  is  hosting  a  passing  band  of  hired  blades  who  are desperate for a contract.

Reduce  the  cost  of  the  first  Mercenary  unit  or  attachment included by all Commanders (ally and enemy) by 1 Coin for this battle.

## (3) Destructive Stormfront

A destructive storm has ravaged an area under your governance. The  population  will  need  time  to  recover  before contributing to your cause again.

The lowest Might Rank faction who shares a border with you or an adjoining  Sea  Region  selects  one  of  your  Regions. Region  and Development Perks for Might, Coin, and Docks are disabled there until the Challenge Phase of the following Month.

## (2) Drunken Revelry

In  a  vain  attempt  to  overcome fears of the coming battle, your troops indulge too much the night before. They will be less alert in the heat of battle.

Suffer -1 Capture Saves to your Faction's Characters in this battle.

## (1) Treacherous Conditions

A brutal environment, this battlefield will prove especially perilous to the heroes who risk their lives upon it.

Suffer  -1  Death  Saves  to  all  Characters  (ally  and  enemy) in  this battle.

## 2v2 and 2v1 Matchups

When two pairs  of  Factions  all  put  forth  Commanders  against each other in the same Region, review the combinations below to determine whether Factions must play, or may decline the battle:

- Challenger/Challenger  vs  Challenger/Challenger  must  be fought as a Team Battle or counts as a Total Defeat with an automatic Injury to any declining Faction.  The Commander whose  ally  declined  may  Withdraw  without  Injury  if  not surrounded.
- Challenger/Challenger  vs Challenger/Skirmisher  must  be fought as a Team Battle.  If the Skirmisher declines to play, see 2v1 Battle rules.
- Challenger/Challenger vs Skirmisher/Skirmisher must be fought as a Team Battle.  If the Skirmisher(s) decline to play, see 2v1 Battle rules or Challengers gain a Total Victory.
- Challenger/Skirmisher vs Challenger/Skirmisher may be fought  as  a  1v1  Battle  if  both  Skirmishers  decline  to  play. Otherwise see 2v1 Battle rules.
- Challenger/Skirmisher vs Skirmisher/Skirmisher the sole Challenger may choose to refuse a Team Battle and instead force  a  1v1  against  the  lower  Might  Rank  Skirmisher  who declared against them.
- Skirmisher/Skirmisher vs Skirmisher/Skirmisher must be fought as a Team Battle or all Commanders Withdraw with no Might gained.

In cases where one Faction finds a willing ally but the opposing Faction has no willing or eligible ally Faction, if either of the allied Factions  are  Skirmishing,  the  solo  Faction  may  decline  a  Team Battle and the lower Might Rank Faction opposing them may no longer put their Commander forth in that Skirmish.

Alternatively, the lone Faction may conscript a second player to take  control  of  a  second  army  from  his  Faction  using  another Available  Commander  from  the  same  Faction.    This  may  also occur when a 2v2 battle had been set during Challenge Phase, but one  involved  faction  subsequently  declines  to  play  the  battle, leaving  their  formerly  allied  Faction  in  a  2v1  battle.    Available Commanders in this case are Commanders which are in Reserve or would be able to reach the battle location according to normal location restrictions for Attachments/NCUs and are not participating in another battle with their Commander version in the same Month.   The lone Faction will then utilize two Tactics decks from the same Faction, each with its respective Commander cards included.  Both lists must be independently legal according to size, bonuses, and Character use (although Transfer Bonus may be employed as usual).  Characters and list size bonuses may not be replicated or used in both lists.  All other Character rules and restrictions apply as normal.  The lone Faction does not accrue double Might for the battle outcome and, if Challenging, does not accrue double Veterancy (select one unit for Veterancy between the two lists).

## Battle Setup

Use the Map Details Sheets to determine the battle type and if the battle area has altered dimensions.  If so, delineate those on your battle surface, compressing any Objectives, Deployment Zones, or Castle Walls symmetrically as necessary.  Determine if there is any mandatory terrain for the Region.  If so, players must alternate placing terrain pieces from the 'Castles and T errain' section first. Then  participants  may  choose  either  'Chosen  by  Players'  or 'Randomized Pool' methods from the CMON Rulebook to place the remaining terrain pieces (up to four) as long as the terrain is not restricted in that Region.  If terrain does not fit on the battle area following  the  normal  requiring  6'  separation  from  other  pieces and remaining outside Deployment Zones, cease placing terrain.

With  Season  6,  CMON  introduced  list  sizes  such  as  '40+4' meaning an army is allowed to include 40 Points for any use along with up to 4 Points which may only been spent on Attachments from their own Faction.  Although players may negotiate and play any base army sizes agreed upon with the approval of a Referee, default army sizes are:

- 1v1 Battle: 30+3 points + list size bonuses
- Team Battle: 20+2 points + list size bonuses

It should be noted that increasing the base army size will inhibit play on compressed maps, and decreasing the base army size will proportionally magnify the impact of list size bonuses.  In cases where  participants  are  unable  to  fit  all  of  their  army's  Combat Units inside their Deployment Zone at the start of a battle, excess units must remain off the battlefield until enough Combat Units have moved forward to create space.  These units are still able to be the target of the Crown Zone, unlimited range attacks, or any other  game  mechanic  that  could  affect  the  excess  units  if  they were in their Deployment Zone.  The excess units must be placed in  the  back of  the Deployment Zone against the Friendly Table Edge as soon as there is space to do so.

For the purposes of this system there is no maximum amount of Victory Points that may be earned to automatically end a battle. Battles only end at the end of Round 6 or by negotiation by the participants prior to that point.

Time constraints should be acknowledged prior to the start of any battle  since  a  player  opting  to  quit  a  battle  early  without  the opponent agreeing to continue it later will incur a Total Defeat.

## Optional Rule - Timed Battles

Community developer Cruellion has an excellent set of rules for timed play that are highly recommended for use when both players agree.  These rules ensure that the game ends within a pre-determined allotment of time.  If one player expends all of their allotted time, the remaining player is allowed to Activate all  of  their  remaining  units  and  perform  Actions  while  the opponent is only allowed to roll Defense Dice.

## Field Battles:

Field Battles are used to resolve Challenges and Skirmishes that occur in a land Region where no Castles are controlled by one of the participants or when the participants decline to use Castles in Break the Siege. To set up a Field Battle, start with the Game of Thrones game mode explained in the CMON Rulebook (page 27 in the Season 6 edition).  Use three Objectives instead of five and orient them deep or wide for Mountain Pass or Coastal Assault maps respectively.

Opponents roll a d6.  The player who rolls highest may choose their Deployment Zone and who deploys first, or they man pass this choice to their opponent.  The player who does not choose their Deployment may choose who is the First Player after Tactics cards are drawn.

## Example: Battle of Oxcross

The first terrain placed must be a Low Wall Type: Open Field

## Battle Types

## Example: Battle of Skirling Pass

Bogs must not be placed

Type: Mountain Pass

## Example: Battle of Cape Kraken

The first terrain placed must be a Bog

Type: Coastal Assault (Deployment Zones are 12' leaving a 12'

neutral zone)

## Break the Siege:

Break the Siege is a game mode developed by Board Man Gaming. These battles are used to resolve Challenges and Skirmishes that occur in a land Region where a Castle is available and its owner wishes to utilize its fortifications for this battle.  Refer to Board Man Gaming - Break the Siege Game Mode v1.3 for all rules and special  Castle  Wall  segments  to  be  used  in  their  appropriate Regions and  circumstances.    Break  the  Siege  also  contains  four custom war machine units that may be used by their respective factions  only  in  Break  the  Siege  battles.    Utilize  standard  war machine miniatures (such as Builder Stone Thrower) as proxies.

See the Castle Reference on the Map Details - South sheet when determining which Castle to use when multiple are available in the Region.  The defender must allocate Points in their army for each of the two Castle Walls that will be included.

Castle Walls are set down prior to terrain placement players may not choose their Deployment zone.  The defender is always on the side of the Castle Walls and always deploys first.  T errain is placed in the standard manner explained prior in this section.  Opponents roll a d6.  The player who rolls highest will be First Player when the game begins.

No  Objective  Cards  and  placed  but  Siege  Attacker  and  Siege Defender Decks must be present.  If players are playing digitally, they  should  roll  a  d10  to  determine  which  card  is  drawn  from those decks if they do not have physical copies.  Digital or physical copies  of  the  Castle  Wall  cards  and  any  present  custom  War Machine cards should be made available to all participants.

## Example: Siege of Seagard

The first terrain piece must be a Low Wall.

Type: Coastal Assault (Deployment Zones are 12' leaving a 12' neutral zone)

## Example: Siege of the Castle Black

(No terrain restrictions)

Type: Field Battle

## Example: Siege of the Eyrie (Mountain Fortress)

Bog must not be placed

Type: Mountain Pass (Eyrie 2'W x 4'D)

Note: The Eyrie is the only map that is 2' wide.  All other Mountain Pass style maps are 3' wide with 4' between the Castle Walls.

## Sea Battles:

Sea  Battles  are  used  to  resolve  Challenges  and  Skirmishes  that occur in a Sea Region.  List size bonuses may not be applied to Cavalry  Units,  Cavalry  Attachments,  or  Cavalry  Solos  in  Sea Battles.  To set up a Sea Battle start with this layout from the Board Man Gaming scenario 'Assault  on  the  Targaryen  Fleet'  using  a standard 4' x 4' battle area.  Gaps between boarding ramps are 5.5'.

Set Deployment Zones 2' back from the sides of the ships and place three Objective tokens at the centers of the three boarding ramps.  As in the Board Man Gaming scenario, the water sections of the battle area have the Torrent keyword:

TORRENT: Units performing Actions while in this T errain piece suffer D6+1 Wounds before resolving that Action.  Units moving into  this  T errain  piece  suffer  D6+1  Wounds (unit  only  suffers damage once during a Charge).

No other terrain may be added unless placed by a unit or Tactics card during the battle.   Controlling Objectives generates Victory Points as normal in the Game of Thrones game mode but they do not grant any Objective cards to buff the units controlling them in this  game  mode.    Opponents  roll  a  d6.    The  player  who  rolls highest  may  choose  who  is  First  Player,  or  they  man  pass  this choice to their opponent.  The player who does not choose First Player will choose who deploys first.

Example: Homemade Sea Battles Overlay

Example:  Online  play  using  terrain  to  mark  ship  hulls  and ramps

## Assembling an Army

In order for players to determine how many list points they are allowed to add to their army size, check all the following:

- Might Rank Bonus - In 1v1 battles the higher Might Rank factions adds the difference of their Might Rank and their opponent's Might Rank.  In Team Battles, add the Might Ranks of teammates together before finding the difference.  This  bonus  may  be  split  between  the  team and,  if  so,  does  not  count  toward  the  point-sharing restriction below (2 Points).
- Region/Development Bonus - Add any Region Perks and unlocked Development Perks from the battle Region for the defender(s).
- Strategy Sheet Bonus - Add any applicable bonuses listed on the Faction Strategy Sheets.
- Coin Bonus - Purchase Points with Coin as follows:
- +1 Point for [Current Month #] x 1 Coin
- +2 Points for [Current Month #] x 2 Coin
- +3 Points for [Current Month #] x 3 Coin (In the case of the Final Battle, count [Current Month #] as 7)
- Transfer Bonus - A teammate may transfer up to +2 Points to their ally but may not fall below the base army size.

Note that multiple bonuses may trigger from including a single unit in your army but each bonus used may only be applied one time per battle.

Factions  may  access  special  effects  that  disable  certain  list  size bonuses of their opponents or restrict the use of certain units. In such  cases,  the  player  imposing  the  restriction  must  alert  their opponent during Challenge Phase or soon thereafter to provide ample  time  for  the  restricted  player  to  adjust  and  make  an appropriate  list. In  cases  where  the  imposing  player  forgets  to declare such restrictions to their opponent without feasible time or after their opponent  has  already  assembled  their  army components  for  play, the targeted opponent  shall not be mandated to change their list.

If all involved players ask to see each other's lists prior to the start of  the battle,  one or two eligible lists  may be presented by the requested faction upon request (the second list being a decoy list that the faction does not actually play).

## Battle Phase Sequence

Every battle that manifested as a result of Challenge phase must be  fought  in  the  following  process  unless  it  is  resolved  by  the involved Factions prior to battle.

- Purchase Mercenaries (-2 Coin per 8 point Neutral Unit, -1  Coin  per  any  other  Neutral  unit  or  Attachment. Bolton Mercenaries may only be taken with the consent of  the  Bolton  Faction  and  the  Coin  spent  to  purchase them is paid directly to the Bolton Faction.
- Log  the  final  army  lists  on  the  Battle  Log  used  by  all involved Factions.
- Fight battles using appropriate map, battle type, and all special effects applicable.
- Document all outcomes on the Battle Log.
- Document Veterancy for Challenging armies (not Skirmishing armies).
- Roll Condition Saves (see next section).
- Negotiate Captives if the Capturing Faction wishes to do so at any time.
- Declare  Challenge  Results  (Sack,  Conquer,  Secure,  or Rout).
- If  this  was  an  Attacker  Victory,  Rescue  one  Captured Character  of  the  Attacker's  Faction  from  the  Defender who owned the Region (Defender's choice of Captive).
- Defeated Commanders declare Regions for Withdraw or are Vanquished.

Repeat  this  process  for  each  Challenge  and  Skirmish  battle throughout  the  Month  until  all  Factions  have  exhausted  or declined their battles.

## Condition Saves

The three conditions that all Characters are able to incur are Injury, Capture, and Death.  A Character may only ever have one condition at a time (a Character may never be both Injured and Captured).  Condition Saves are d6 rolls made by a player controlling that Character to see if the associated condition is incurred.  By default:

- 1s are failures of that test, resulting in the Character gaining the new condition.
- 2-6s are successes of that test, meaning the Character does not gain the new condition.

Just like the base game rules in ASOAIF TMG, there are lots of ways to add positive and negative modifiers to these dice rolls. Calculate all these modifiers when making your roll but note that regardless of modifiers, 1s are always failures and 6s are always successes.

The most common time that Condition Saves are rolled is at the conclusion of a battle (see the previous section).  At the conclusion of every battle, note which Characters were out of play at end of the game.  A Character's NCU version who was not on the Tactics Board at the end of the game is generally still 'in play' unless they had been permanently removed by poison or another effect.  Use the following sequence to determine Condition Saves for Characters who were out of play:

- Roll Injury Saves, if any were triggered by special effects.
- Roll Death Saves.  All Characters who were out of play at the end of the battle are now Injured.  Roll Death Saves for those Character now, surviving on a 2+ and remaining Injured.
- Roll Capture Saves.  If you suffered a defeat or draw in this battle, roll Capture Saves for any Characters who passed their  Death  Save  in  the  previous  step.    On  a  2+  they escape Capture and remain Injured instead.
- In  Team  Battles,  determine  who  holds  the  Captured Characters.   Note that opponents may decline to take captives,  leaving  Characters  who  failed  their  Capture Saves as Injured instead.

## Defeat and Victory Outcomes

When players participating in a battle decide to come to a resolution before one army is destroyed or the end of Round 6, consult the outcomes below to determine what type of Victory or Defeat is granted to each side of the conflict.  Note that battles may only be resolved at the end of Round.  If a player resigns or ceases to play in the middle of a Round and the opponent has not agreed to pause the game and finish it at a later time, the opponent may continue to play and Activate each remaining unit the end of the Round.  In such cases, the resigning player may only roll Defense Dice (See 'Optional Rule - Timed Games' on page 20).

| Outcome          | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                          | Effects                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Pyrrhic Victory  | Any Victory where the winning side has only one Combat Unit (or only Castle Walls) remaining. This Outcome overrides any other Victory.                                            | Gain +2 Might, May not Capture enemy Characters                                                                                                                          |

Note that Total, Decisive, and Close Outcomes must always be paired with each other unless overridden by a Pyrrhic Victory.

Referees shall prevent any egregious exploitation of this system for the mutual generation of Might without competition.  Referees should not allow for compromised negotiated outcomes if either player is pressuring their opponent to consent to a worse outcome because of real world time constraints or if opposing players are colluding to inflate Might gains rather than fighting to win.

## Challenge Results

Upon winning a victory, Factions may choose the following results and pay the associated Might cost.  Defender results may be chosen whenever a Faction fought at a Region/Development controlled by themselves or a consenting ally Faction.  All other victories are considered attacker victories.  When two teammates are victorious in a battle, one Challenge Result may be selected by each Faction.

| Result   | Victory Type   | Cost                                                                                              | Effects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Captured Characters & Regicide

Captured Characters generate Might for the Faction holding them at the start of each Month.

- All Captured Characters generate +2 Might.
- Characters who have Commander versions generate +1 additional Might
- Characters  who  held  any  position  on  the  Iron  Throne Strategy Sheet at the time of their Capture generate +2 additional Might
- Characters named under the 'King or Queen of the Seven Kingdoms'  section  on  the  Iron  Throne  Strategy  Sheet (even  if they  did  not  hold  that  title)  generate  +3 additional Might.

Captured Characters may be returned to their original Factions through one of four means: Negotiation, Rescue, Escape, or Trial by Combat.

Negotiation may cause the return of the Captured Character at any  time  for  an  exchange  of  Coin  or  any  other  diplomatic agreement with the authorization of the Faction Leader holding the Captive.

Factions may Rescue their Captured Characters back by winning a battle as an attacker (not a defender) against the faction holding the  Captive. The  attacking  Faction  may  rescue  one  Captured character on a Victory. If the Faction holding the Captive has more than one Captive of that faction, the Faction holding the Captives chooses which Character was Rescued.

During Council Phase a Faction may declare that their Character who is held by another Faction is attempting an  Escape.  They must then roll a d6.  (Note that if the Brotherhood declares a Trial by Combat, the opportunity for Escape is suspended until that Trial is resolved.)

- On  a 1, the Character  who  attempted Escape is unavoidably Killed by their captors.
- On a  2-5,  the  Character  remains  in  captivity  and  may never make another Escape roll until after they have been freed.
- On a 6, the Character Escapes captivity and returns to their Faction.

See the Brotherhood Strategy Sheet for details on Trial by Combat.

Take  note  of  Captured  Neutral  Characters  at  the  start  of  the Month.    They  generate  Might  in  the  same  manner  as  other Captured Characters one time.  The Faction holding the Neutral Character  may  bid  on  that  Character  in  the  Neutral  Character auction with a +3 Coin equivalent credit.  If that Faction wins the bid, the Character is immediately released and joins the Faction that held them Captive (unless Character Traits dictate a change in that Character's Faction).  If that Faction declines to bid for the Character, they may choose to continue holding the Character as a Captive but will no longer generate any Might for doing so during that stint of captivity.

A Regicide occurs whenever a Character is killed while bearing the title  'King  or  Queen  of  the  Seven  Kingdoms'  through  the  Iron Throne Strategy Sheet.  The Faction (or Factions in the case of Death during a team battle) that caused the Death immediately gain +20 Might.

## Veterancy

At the conclusion of a battle, all involved factions for which this was a Challenge battle may choose one non-unique combat unit which was still on the board at the end of the game. If that unit contains an Attachment, it must deploy with the same Attachment  in  all  future  battles. The  Attachment  may  be  a Character.  If so, log the correct version of that Character.  Roll a d8 for a Veterancy effect on the following table, give the unit a unique name, and log it under the faction's Veteran Units. This unit's Wounds and Campaign Map location must now be tracked and maintained after every battle unless it is absent from battle for an entire Month, at which point it may be redeployed at full health in  any  battle.  Veteran  Units may  not appear  in  multiple battles during the same Month.  They may continue to accrue further Veteran effects, re-rolling if they roll an effect they have already obtained.  Veteran units continue to garner the list size bonuses from  their  base  unit  type.    Neutral  Veteran  units  which  had originally cost Coin to deploy continue to cost the same amount of Coin each time they are deployed.

Local Veterans are a set of pre-designated units in each faction that may be unlocked the first time their Faction plays a battle in their unlock Region and includes that unit type in their list.  If that unit  type  supports  Attachments,  you  may  include  any  eligible Commander or Attachment in that unit during its first battle.  In all subsequent battles with that Veteran unit, it must include the same Attachment.  Local Veterans are unlike other Veterans in the following ways:

- Local Veterans may be unlocked even if their Faction is participating in a Skirmish battle in the unlock Region.
- Local  Veterans  begin  their  first  battle  with  one  predetermined Veteran Perk unlocked and then get to roll for their  second  Veteran  Perk  at  the  conclusion  of  that battle.

## Depleted Reserves

After a battle is fought in a Region it gains the condition Depleted Reserves  for  one  Month  following  the  current  Month. When another battle occurs in the effected Region, Factions may not use any  individual  army  list  size  bonuses  that  were  utilized  in  their army creation the previous Month.

When determining whether or not a bonus can be used under these  circumstances,  review  the  Battle  Log  of  the  previous Month's battle. Bonuses of the same type from the same source are  not  allowed  to  be  reused. Bonuses  of  the  same  type  from different sources or bonuses from the same source which require a cost may be reused.

Example  1: Renly  Baratheon  fights  a  battle  in  Storm's  End  in Month 2 and utilizes the Region Perk "Renly Baratheon +3" and the Loyalty and Legitimacy bonus "Alester Florent +1" to expand the  size  of  his  army. If  the  Baratheons  fight  another  battle  in Storm's  End  in  Month  3,  these  bonuses  are  not  available  that Month.

Example 2. Roose Bolton fights a battle in the Neck and pays 4 Schemes  to  gain  stacked  bonuses  from  Brutal  Leadership. The following Month he fights another battle in the Neck and spends 2 more Schemes to gain a single instance of Brutal Leadership for the battle. He is able to do so as long as he pays the Schemes.

Example  3: Marselen  fights  a  battle  in  King's  Landing  during  a Month when the City Pacification War Focus is active. As one of his  three  optional  perks  he  utilizes  "Unsullied  Swordmasters +1". The following Month Grey Worms fights another battle in King's Landing, this time with the Dragon Dominance War Focus active. Grey  Worm  would  not  be  allowed  to  take  "Unsullied Swordmasters +1" as an optional perk since the same bonus was used  the  previous  Month. However,  Grey  Worm  would  be allowed to purchase this bonus at a cost of -1 Might as one of his additional perks in the normal manner.

Note: When a double Challenge takes  place in  the  Eyrie  in  the  same Month (the only Region this may occur), Depleted Reserves does not occur from either of those battles until they are both fought (the first battle played does not inhibit the second).

## The Final Battle

At  the  end  of  Month  6,  one  final  tabulation  of  Might  occurs, drawing from all the usual 'start of Month' sources plus any other specified effects.  A final Might Ranking must be constructed.

The  Final  Battle  is  fought  after  the  end  of  Month  6  using  the system below. It  is  intended to give a distinct advantage to the Might Leader but provide one last ditch opportunity for the Might Challenger to upset the Campaign.  It is fought between the Might Leader and Might Challenger to determine the final winner of the Campaign.

Might Leader - The Faction holding Might Rank 1at the end of Month 6

Might Challenger - Top Might Rank Faction who wishes to oppose the Might Leader at the end of Month 6

The Might Leader selects 1v1 or Team Battle for the Final Battle. If Team Battle is selected, the teammates of the Might Leader and Might Challenger are chosen by the Might Rank of the teammate who wishes to join the Final Battle and not by the choice of the Might Leader or the Might Challenger, ignoring the usual rule that would allow them to do so.  The Might Leader then selects a battle type: Field Battle, Sea Battle, Break the Siege - Attacker or Break the Siege - Defender.

If Break the Siege - Defender is chosen, the Might Challenger selects any Capital controlled by the Might Leader for the battle to take place. If no such Capitals are owned, the Might Challenger selects any owned Region or Development with a controlled Castle. The Might Leader may choose any owned Castle in that Region. The Might Challenger wins the Campaign on a Victory or Draw in this battle.

If any other battle type is chosen, the Might Leader selects an eligible Region or Development held by the Might Challenger. If Break the Siege - Attacker was selected the Region must contain a Castle and the Might Challenger may choose any controlled Castle in that Region or its Development. The Might Leader wins the Campaign on a Victory or Draw in this battle.

The Might Leader may choose to increase the base army list size to 30+3 for a Team Battle or 40+4 for a 1v1 battle.  If so, CMON's Epic Game Size Rules may be used (Expanded Tactics Board, expanded Tactics hand size, reshuffling discard piles during Round 3 clean-up, and/or expanded game board in the case of Field Battles.  Army lists and Commanders are not revealed to the opposing sides until the start of the Final Battle. The Might battle is not affected by any Events.

The following rules and restrictions are exempted for the Final Battle:

- No location restrictions exist for Characters and no Interceptions may occur en route to this battle.
- Any Characters who are not Injured, Captured, or Dead may participate in this battle.
- Depleted Reserves does not affect this battle. Any Region or Development Perks apply as usual.
- House Targaryen retains the War Focus set in Month 6 and may purchase list size bonus perks as usual.
- House Bolton Brutal Leadership may be used 2x (like normal) if Schemes are available.
- Night's Watch Strategy Sheet bonuses apply if the Final Battle takes place in a Wall Region.
- Free Folk retains the Motivation T rack state and bonuses from the beginning of Month 6 even if Commanders from the track were lost since then.
- House Stark Homefront Banners and March of Honor may apply as usual.
- House Greyjoy gains all strategy bonuses relevant to an Iron Fleet if one is eligible and utilized for the battle. Strategy debuffs applied to the enemy for Sea Battles also apply in cases when the Final Battle is a Sea Battle. However, in such cases the Greyjoy's opponent wins on a Draw, regardless of whether House Greyjoy is fighting as/for the Might Leader or Might Challenger.
- Brotherhood Without Banners Unconventional Warfare effects and King's Justice bonuses remain as normal.
- House Lannister Mercenary Monopoly discount still applies.
- House Martell eligible unlocked effects from Prince's Intrigues still apply.
- House Baratheon Loyalty and Legitimacy bonuses remain in effect. If Renly and Stannis are both alive at the end of Month 6 and the Baratheons participate in the Final Battle, their opponents always win on a Draw regardless of Battle Type.
