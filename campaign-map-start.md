Castle Reference
When a battle takes place in a Region with one or more available Castles, the defender may choose for that battle to be a Break the Siege battle.  The defender may instead opt to have a Field Battle to avoid spending any list points on Castle Walls.  Once Break the Siege has been selected, the Castle must be determined and the defender may no longer opt for a Field Battle.  When determining which Castle in a Region will be used to resolve a battle, unless Castles with (R) are selected by the attacker, the defender may choose an available castle after reading the criteria below.  In cases where a Castle matching the defender's Faction is available, the defender must choose their faction's version of that Castle.  If their own Faction's version is not available, they must choose the Neutral version of that Castle.  If neither are available, the defender may play using another Faction's version of the Castle.  Ignore any Castle Loyalty.
(B) - Only the Brotherhood Without Banners may select this Castle and may not be used in a Team Battle.
(D) - The defender may only select this Castle if they control the Development or have the consent of the faction who controls the Development.
(E) - Immune to (5) Lure the Garrison.  When the Eyrie is held by any Faction it may be the site of two Challenge Break the Siege battles per Month, or three such battles if the Development is also held by the same Faction or a consenting Faction.  In such cases, attacking forces must fight the battles in sequence:
- First at the Gates of the Moon (if the Development is held) where victorious attackers may only choose to Sack, not Conquer.  If the attackers are defeated here, all attacking Commanders in the subsequent battles are forced to Withdraw from the Eyrie.
- Next at the Waycastles where the victorious attackers may choose to Conquer, but doing so does not yet change control of the Region.  If the attackers are defeated here, all attacking Commanders in subsequent battles are forced to Withdraw from the Eyrie.  Depleted Reserves does not apply from prior battles here in the same Month.
- Last at the Eyrie, where the victorious attackers may choose to Conquer again, this time changing control of the Region.  Depleted Reserves does not apply from prior battles here in the same Month.
(R) - The attacker(s) must declare they will not Conquer if they are victorious before the start of the battle and then they may choose to attack this Castle.
(N) - The Nightfort Abandoned Castle must be restored and held by the Night's Watch for this battle to be selected.  Only the Night's Watch or Baratheons may use their respective versions of this Castle (the Baratheons must be allied with the Night's Watch and acting as a defender in the Castle Black Region while it is held by Night's Watch).
(S) - One Castle of this type may be selected by the defender if one of the attackers arrived in this Region from an adjacent Sea Region.
(T) - Whichever Development is Controlled by the defender (or with the consent of the Development owner) unlocks use of the respective Castle
