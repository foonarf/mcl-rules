Firstly,  the  awesome  folks  at  CMON  who  have  made  this  superb wargame: A Song of Ice and Fire Miniatures Game -- Thank you for this  material! Secondly,  the  ASOIAF  Miniatures  community  on Discord -- Thank you for your creativity!  Special thanks to Board Man Gaming for his Break the Siege custom game type which is directly used in this system among his other inspiring works. Special thanks to  Grognard's  Campaign  System  and  Edgehopper who  introduced me  to  it. Many  large  pieces  of  that  system  were  laid  down  as foundation blocks for the Milestone Campaign League System, and credit for all those ideas should be given to them.

## Design and Intent

The Milestone Campaign League is a narrative game system designed to be played over six months by ten faction leaders (along with any number of extra players supporting them) which utilizes the CMON Ice  and  Fire  Miniatures  Game  to  resolve  battles. This  system  is designed to only marginally alter the fundamental mechanics of the Ice and Fire Miniatures Game battles that occur within it. However, unlike  the  canon  gameplay,  these  battles  will  almost  always  be asymmetrical with odds solidly favoring one side or the other. Players who  prefer  balanced  and  tuned  gameplay  (at  least  to  CMON standards) with well-established "meta" army lists may not enjoy this system. Be warned!

Players  who  are  looking  for  mechanics  that  incentivize  play  well outside the "meta" and who are open to battle goals other than total victory (such as killing an enemy hero to keep them out of the rest of the campaign) are encouraged to try this system. To the real ones out there who have the smarts to be a min-max try-hard but choose to put flavor over function every once in a while, so everyone can have a good time -- this one's for you.

The design priorities of this system are…

- First, fun for the participants
- Second, respect for the lore
- Third, game balance which is subordinate to the others

As I do not own or profit from the commercial source materials, feel free to alter this system to your group's preferences.

## Overview

The Vassal Lords is an expansion pack for the Milestone Campaign League which operates using A Song of Ice and Fire Miniatures Game by CMON.  It adds three minor Factions based on homebrew and provide expanded options for play.

The minor Factions introduced in this material are:

House Arryn - by Shane at Board Man Gaming

House Tyrell - originally by Stormlord and now developed by Kullvox

House Tully - by Kullvox

Complete  material  for  running  battles  with  House  Arryn  can.be found  at  BoardManGaming.wixsite.com.  Materials  for  House  Tully and House Tyrell can be found at the Patreon.com/Kullvox.

The Vassal Lords expansion pack further adds thirteen Diplomatic Cards to the game, which give all of the existing Factions, as well as the  base  game  Factions,  new  ways  to  form  alliances  and  exert leverage on each other away from the battlefield.

## Setup

Campaign Organizers who add The Vassal Lords should do so from the start of  their  Campaign and should have at least one to three players ready to participate as Faction Leaders for the minor factions in this expansion.  Those players should be aware that they will not be able to "win" the Campaign on their own strength while playing as a Vassal but will have the opportunity to become the teammate of the final winning Faction.

It is not recommended that more than three players be assigned to a single minor Faction. Unlike the base game Factions, excess players in these  Factions  will  likely  find  themselves  with  minimal  ways  to participate in the Campaign.

It  is  not  recommended that you conduct a Campaign adding only one  of  the  new  Factions  from  this  supplement.    This  material  is designed  such  that  it  is  very  likely  for  these  Factions  to  end  up supporting and boosting the top-ranked Factions at the end of the Campaign.  If only one of these new Factions is in play, they will likely determine who the winner of the Campaign is based solely on their support.    Using  two  of  the  new  Factions  should  provide  an acceptable counterbalance for enjoyable play.  Using all three is ideal for design balance and competition.

All Campaign Referees should be versed in this expansion.  To use this expansion, prepare the following:

- Take  the  Strategy  Sheets  from  this  supplement  and  add them with Strategy Sheet Logs from the base game.
- Take the Character Trait Sheets from this supplement and combine them with Veteran Logs from the base game.
- Replace  the  Map  Details  Sheets  from  the  base  game  and replace  them  with  the  Map  Details  Sheets from  this supplement.

If you are not using House Tully, do not replace Map Details - West.

If you are not using House Arryn, do not replace Map Details - East.

If you are not using House Tyrell, do not replace Map Details - South.

- Replace the base game's Map Details (Editable) with Vassal Lords Map Details (Editable).
- If not using specific new factions, edit as above.

You  are  now  ready  to  play  the  Milestone  Campaign  League  with additional players using The Vassal Lords expansion pack.  Enjoy!

## Glossary

Diplomacy Card - A set of cards with unique versions for each of the thirteen Factions in MCL (ten base game Factions plus three Factions introduced in this supplement).  These cards are held by their own Factions at the start of the Campaign and then traded between the Factions  during  Council  Phase.    Each  Faction  may  hold  only  one Diplomatic Card from another Faction at any time, and the card may not be recalled by the originating Faction until the next subsequent Council Phase.

Diplomatic  Boon  -  The  first  section  of  a  Diplomatic  Card  that defines  a  persistent,  Faction-wide  benefit  to  the  target  Faction (the Faction that was given the card).

Marriage Alliance - The second section of a Diplomatic Card that defines  a  persistent,  Faction-wide  benefit  to both  the  target Faction holding the card as well as the originating Faction who sent the card.  This section must be unlocked by declaring a marriage between one Character in each of the two factions, one male and one female.

Violation Condition - The third section of a Diplomatic Card that defines an automatic, unavoidable penalty that is suffered by the Faction holding the card if they act against the originating Faction during Challenge Phase (see page 6).

Overlord - One of the ten base game Factions that has accepted a 'declaration of fealty' by one of the three Vassal Factions introduced in this supplement: House Arryn, House Tyrell, or House Tully.  The Overlord Faction has extensive authority and control over the actions performed by the Vassal Faction until that relationship is ended by the  Vassal  Faction  declaring  a  different  Overlord  or  their  own independence during a subsequent Council Phase.

Vassal - One of three minor Factions introduced in this supplement (House Arryn, House Tyrell, or House Tully) that must interact with the ten base game factions under a special set of limitations.

Independent Might Rank - The number from 1-10 that a Vassal Faction must treat as their Might Rank unless they have a current Overlord  (in  which  case  they  share  that  Faction's  Might  Rank). Vassals always act after base game Factions who share their Might Rank  and  are  considered  to  be  lower  Might  Rank,  rather  than equal, for the purpose of settling any disputes.

Vassal Diplomacy - A unique rule that dictates how Might, Coin, and other game mechanics interact between a specific Vassal and any Overlord to which they have currently sworn fealty.

Overlord Rule - A set of requirements that dictate which Factions a Vassal may swear fealty to as an Overlord, or if they may declare independence from any Overlord.

Challenge  Condition  -  A  specific  Event  that  a  Vassal  Faction utilizes every time they put forth a Challenge, rather than rolling a d20.  Use of this Event does not remove it from the pool of Events that may be rolled by other Factions during Challenge Phase.

## INDEPENDENT MIGHT RANK: 4

## VASSAL DIPLOMACY

When House Tyrell becomes a Vassal, transfer all current Might to your Overlord immediately when the Overlord is declared during Council Phase each Month. House Tyrell is not required to transfer any Coin to their Overlord until the end of Month 6. Highgarden (and Horn Hill if unlocked) remains under the control of House Tyrell unless it is Conquered by a Faction other than its Overlord. It is never transferred to the Overlord of House Tyrell until the end of Month 6. If House Tyrell declares independence or changes its Overlord, select up to three Regions in the Reach and their unlocked Developments. Paying -5 Coin per Region, you immediately take control of them as House Tyrell (if independent) or your new Overlord.

## OVERLORD RULE

- Month 1 - House Baratheon
- Month 2 - Must be House Baratheon if Renly Baratheon has not been Killed / Otherwise must be any faction above Might Rank 5
- Month 3 - Must be any faction above Might Rank 5 and current Coin greater than 10 at the start of Council Phase / Otherwise may be independent
- Month 4 - Must be any faction above Might Rank 4 and current Coin greater than 15 at the start of Council Phase / Otherwise may be independent
- Month 5 - Must be any faction above Might Rank 3 and current Coin greater than 20 at the start of Council Phase / Otherwise may be independent
- Month 6 - Any faction / Must not be independent

## CURRENT OVERLORD:

## CHALLENGE CONDITION: FERTILE HOMELAND

When House Tyrell Commanders are put forth in a Challenge, they always gain Event (17) Construction Boon. Do not count this Event as having been rolled. Another faction may still roll this Event this Month.

## Vassals & Overlords

Vassals  are  minor  Factions  added  in  this  expansion:  House  Tully, House  Arryn,  and  House  Tyrell.    They  are  each  intended  to  be controlled  by  a  single  Faction  Leader  who  participates  in  Council, Challenge, and Battle Phases along with all the other players.  Each Month that  player  will  make  decisions  about  the  control  of  their faction based on their Strategy Sheet, including the decision about which faction the Vassal selects as its Overlord faction during Council Phase.  That Faction is declared as the Overlord by the Vassal Faction ('swearing fealty') but the potential Overlord may refuse to accept the potential Vassal (because they wish to take on a different Vassal or for any other reason).

If  your  Campaign  does  not  have  any  players  assigned  to  a  Vassal Faction, treat that faction's Regions as Neutral (except for Highgarden which should be treated as Baratheon at Campaign start) and disregard unused Character Traits Sheets.

Vassals only have a single Challenge to spend during Challenge Phase and do not roll for Events.  Like other factions, they may put forth any number of Skirmishes as long as they have available Commanders. Vassals use their Independent Might Rank when they are not linked to  an  Overlord  Faction but must  always act  after  whichever  other Faction shares that Might Rank.  When a Vassal swears fealty to an Overlord  during  Council  Phase,  that  declaration  must  be  made before the Vassal performs any other actions in that Council Phase (such as purchasing a Development).

Any  of  the  base  game  Factions  may  eventually  be  selected  as  an Overlord  Faction  (with  timing  exceptions  for  Night's  Watch  and Brotherhood Without Banners listed below) to which a Vassal may swear fealty during Council Phase as long as the conditions on the Vassal's  Strategy  Sheet  are  met.    A  Vassal  may  instead  choose  to remain independent if that is listed as an eligible option in the current Month.  An Overlord may only have only one attached Vassal at a time.  Potential Overlord Factions are expected to compete for and make overtures to Vassals from which they hope to obtain fealty.

When a Vassal swears fealty to an Overlord they immediately transfer ownership of all Regions and attached unlocked Developments (of the same ownership) to their Overlord.  The Vassal may still benefit from  any  list  size  bonuses  under  Region  or  Development  Perks controlled  by  their  Overlord.    The  Vassal  halts  the  use  of  its Independent Might Rank and shares the Might Rank of its current Overlord, always acting after the Overlord during Challenge Phase. The Overlord has final authority and direction over the Vassal during Council and Challenge Phases with the following exceptions:

- The  Vassal  retains  direct  control  over  anything  expressly stated in their Strategy Sheet and Character Traits Sheet as well as their own army list building and battlefield command. They  also  continue  to  control  where  they  send  their Diplomacy card  and  whether  or  not  to  accept  any  other Faction's Diplomacy Card.
- The Vassal continues to determine which Overlord they will swear fealty to each  Month or if they will remain Independent.

Vassals cannot win the Campaign by themselves, but they do have the opportunity to swear fealty to the future Might Leader or Might Challenger and earn a spot on the winning team.  A Might Leader or Might Challenger may choose to set aside their Vassal as a teammate for the Final Battle in favor of another allied faction (see page 9).

Night's  Watch  and  Brotherhood  Without  Banners  may  only  be declared as Overlords to a Vassal during Council Phase in Month 6 (see page 7).

## Diplomacy Cards

Diplomacy Cards are unique cards that each Faction can give to one other faction during Council Phase.  The Faction named on the card is the "originating faction" and the other Faction holding the card is the "target faction".  Once a Diplomatic Card has been given from an originating  faction  to  a  target  faction  in  Council  Phase,  it  is  not recalled to the originating faction until the next Council Phase.  Each faction may be the target of only one Diplomacy Card at any given time and may decline to be the target of a Diplomacy Card at the time  it  is  offered  (usually  because  they  wish  to  hold  a  different Faction's card instead).  Each Diplomacy Card has three sections.

The first section describes the general Diplomatic Boon: an exclusive reward to the target faction.  The effects of these boons persist on the target faction until the next Council Phase even if the Violation Consequence  is  triggered  before  that  Council  Phase.    Diplomatic Boons  are  calibrated  to  synchronize  with  the  playstyle  of  the originating Faction, incentivizing the target Faction to operate in a manner more aligned with them in exchange for increased power and rewards in that style of play.  Factions who are trying to entice their peers  into  an  alliance  should  advertise  the  benefits  of  their  card.

The  second  section  describes  the  effects  of  a  Marriage  Alliance. Marriage  Alliances  are  declarations  that  lock  in  a  Diplomacy  Card with a target Faction, preventing the originating faction from being able to recall the card in a subsequent Council Phase.  To declare a Marriage Alliance, both participating Factions declare one Character, one male and one female.  Note that if either Character ever changes Factions, or is not re-obtained by the allied faction in the course of the  Neutral  character  auction,  this  will  immediately  terminate  the Marriage Alliance.  The target faction will then hold the Diplomacy Card  of  the  originating  faction  perpetually  until  a  Council  Phase following  the  Death  of  one  of  those  named  Characters.    Marriage Alliance benefits are shared by both Factions but halt immediately at the time of either Character Death.  Each faction may only join into one Marriage Alliance per Council Phase.  (Therefore two factions who wanted to exchange Diplomacy Cards and amplify both cards with Marriage Alliances would have to do so over the course of two Council  Phases.)    Additionally,  the  two  Characters  named  in  the Marriage alliance gain the following effects for their Factions:

- Commander versions of the Characters may be placed on the map from Reserve in Regions held by the allied Faction. All other normal location restrictions still apply.
- Attachment versions of the Characters gain +1 Might if they participate in Team Battles on the side of the allied faction and are still in play the conclusion.
- NCU  versions  of  the  Characters  gain  +1  Coin  if  they participate in Team Battles on the side of the allied faction and are still in play at the conclusion.
- If this Character is the King or Queen of the Seven Kingdoms the  other  Character  generates  +5  Might  each  time  their counterpart receives Might for that title.

The last section describes Violation Consequence.  This is a penalty applied to the target faction if they put forth any Commanders in Challenge Phase for battles in opposition to the originating faction. Note that this penalty is not triggered if:

- The originating faction first Challenges a Region held by the target faction and the target faction puts forth a Commander in an opposing Challenge or Skirmish.
- The target faction Challenges or Skirmishes in a non-allied region and the originating faction puts forth a Commander in an opposing Challenge or Skirmish.
- The target faction puts forth a Commander in a Challenge or Skirmish in an allied Region with the consent of the ally at the time of placement.

If the Violation Consequence is triggered, the Diplomacy Card will be eligible to be recalled by the originating faction during the subsequent Council Phase, even if a Marriage Alliance is in effect for that  card.    Recalling  the  card  will  end  the  Marriage  Alliance, preventing  those  two  factions  from  creating  any  new  Marriage Alliances with each other for the remainder of the Campaign.

Note that there is no automatic detriment to the originating Faction for attacking the target Faction holding their Diplomatic Card during Challenge  Phase.    Players  should  consider  that  there  is  an  innate disadvantage in many cases for the originating Faction to do so (i.e. they are not amplifying the strength of a true ally they wish to partner with).  However, especially cunning or unscrupulous Factions may use their  Diplomatic  Boons  to  lure  target  Factions  into  playing  in  a manner  that  leaves  them  vulnerable  to  a  surprise  strike  during Challenge Phase.  This is a legitimate strategy - be warned!

## Miscellaneous Interactions

General - Vassal Factions may contribute Characters to (20) Lavish Tourney).

Free Folk - If the Free Folk become an Overlord to a Vassal Faction, Kneel to No Man remains in effect for rolling Free Folk Challenges, but their  Vassal  may  still  gain  the  effect  of  any  relevant  Challenge Condition.

House Baratheon - Baratheons may never gain the benefits of Rungs on the Ladder (page 8) if House Tyrell was played during the course of the Campaign due to their relationship as an Overlord in Month 1. Baratheons may count Highgarden under Sworn Houses if it is held by the Tyrells while the Baratheons are their Overlord.

House Bolton - When Boltons are acting as an Overlord to a Vassal Faction they may direct a Challenge with a Commander belonging to their Vassal to trigger the effect of Perfect Betrayal as long as they are Challenging against a Faction that previously fought a battle alongside the Boltons.

Brotherhood Without Banners - The Brotherhood without Banners cannot accept the fealty of any Vassal Faction as its Overlord until Month 6, at which time Justice Restored may be triggered.  Vassals may not be forced by their Overlord to contribute a Character as a Champion to any Trial by Combat.

Justice  Restored  -  When  the  Brotherhood  Without  Banners becomes Overlord to a Vassal Faction, the Regions currently held by that Vassal should be labelled as belonging to the Vassal, not the  Overlord.    Any  unlocked  Developments  in  those  Regions immediately become  Brotherhood-controlled Developments. For each Development taken by the Brotherhood with this effect, the Brotherhood gains +4 Might.

House Greyjoy - When Greyjoys are acting as an Overlord to a Vassal Faction they may utilize one Commander from that Vassal Faction's roster as a Fleet Captain, granting the special Sea Region movement abilities of Fleet Captains and filling one of the eight Iron Fleet slots on  the  Greyjoy  Strategy  Sheet.    If  House  Greyjoy  ceases  to  be Overlord to that Vassal Faction, the Iron Fleet must be removed or the  Fleet  Captain  slot  must  be  replaced  by  an  eligible  Greyjoy Character.

House Lannister  -  When Lannisters  are acting  as  an  Overlord  to  a Vassal Faction, Neutral Characters in service to House Lannister may be deployed freely into the armies of their Vassal during Battle Phase. Normal version and location restrictions still apply.

House  Martell  -  Prince's  Intrigues  may  target  Vassal  Factions. Intrigues  targeting  an  Overlord  Faction  apply  their  effects  to  any Vassal Faction as long as they have currently declared fealty to that Overlord.

Night's  Watch  -  Vassal  Factions  may  contribute  Might  to  restore Abandoned  Castles  at  the  Wall  during  Council  Phase  if  they  are independent.  If a Vassal Faction has currently declared fealty to an Overlord, that Vassal Faction may only contribute Might to the Wall with the express permission of their Overlord Faction.  The Night's Watch cannot accept the fealty of any Vassal Faction as its Overlord until  Month  6,  at  which  time  Fighting  the  T rue  Enemy  may  be triggered.

Fighting  the  T rue  Enemy  -  When  the  Night's  Watch  becomes Overlord to a Vassal Faction, the Night's Watch immediately gains +5  Might  for  each  Commander  in  that  Faction  who  is  not Captured or Dead.

House Stark - If House Tully was in play during Month 2 and House Stark accepted the role as Overlord as a Result of Sacrifice I, the Starks may not gain the benefit of Rungs on the Ladder (page 8).  They are also prohibited if they act as an Overlord to any other Vassal Faction throughout the Campaign.

House Targaryen - When Targaryens are acting as an Overlord to a Vassal  Faction,  that  Vassal  Faction  may  use  the  effects  of  Essosi Armada.    Additionally,  Challenges  made  by  that  Vassal  Faction generate Might through Quell the Kingdoms for the Targaryens, but their  Commanders  do  not  generate  Might  through  Depth  of Command.

## Rungs on the Ladder

Some base game Factions may view the new Vassals introduced in this supplement as only obstacles with their strategy to rule Westeros. After all, for Factions who choose not to court the fealty of Vassals, other Overlord Factions are only becoming a stronger threat with the addition of these new game systems.  These Factions who choose to stand  without  the  fealty  of  any  Vassal  throughout  the  Campaign should view Vassals as merely another rung on the ladder to their own ascension.

## Each faction that was never a Vassal or Overlord at any point during the Campaign is eligible to gain the following at the end of Month 6:

- Gain  +20  Might  if  you  Conquered  Riverrun  while  it  was under the control of House Tully or their Overlord.
- Gain  +20  Might  if  you  Conquered  the  Eyrie  while  it  was under the control of House Arryn or their Overlord.
- Gain +20 Might if you Conquered Highgarden while it was under the control of House Tyrell or their Overlord.

Factions  may  not  duplicate  these  bonuses  if  they  Conquered  the same  Capital  twice  from  the  same  Vassal  or  Overlord  in  a  single Campaign.    If  two  Factions  attack  one  of  the  Capitals  under  the conditions listed above and are victorious in a Team Battle, only the Faction  that  chooses  the  Challenge  Result  Conquer  will  gain  the associated Might.

## Endgame

Each Vassal Faction transfers the remaining balance of their current Might to their Overlord at the end of Month 6.  This occurs with the final Might tabulations and counts toward the Final Might Ranking

Although Vassals cannot win the Campaign by themselves, they do have the opportunity to swear fealty to the future Might Leader or Might Challenger and earn a spot on the winning team.  A Might Leader or Might Challenger may choose to set aside their Vassal as a teammate for the Final Battle in favor of another allied Faction.  Thus it may become a key point of fealty negotiations that, if the Overlord wins a spot in the Final Battle, they promise to include their Vassal as their teammate.  (Keep in mind that this is not enforceable by the rules and that the promise is only as good as their word!)

When a Team Battle is  chosen  as  the  Final  Battle  type,  the  Might Leader and Might Challenge individually have the option to include as their teammate either:

- Their own current Vassal
- The  next  base  game  Faction  who  wishes  to  be  their teammate in order of Might Rank

When a Vassal Faction is participating in the Final Battle, note the following effects:

- If House Arryn participates in the Final Battle, they may field two  Commanders  instead  of  one  using  the  effect  of  (10) Plentiful Leadership.
- If  House  Tyrell  participates  in  the  Final  Battle,  use  their Overlord's current total Coin amount rather than their own when determining bonuses from Ladder of Thorns.
- If House Tully participates in the Final Battle, the affects of Justice of the Cause persist in their same state from Month 6.
